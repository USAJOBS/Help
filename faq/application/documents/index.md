Job announcements will indicate the need to supply one or more of these types of documents in the **How to Apply** section.

## All

### Cover letter

A cover letter may be included if there is additional information you wish to express to the hiring authorities that is outside of what is normally included in a resume.

### Transcripts

A transcript is a copy of your permanent academic record from a high school or college. To get a copy, contact the high school and/or college registrar office for instructions. Refer to the job announcement for specific instructions on which transcripts, if any, should be included.

### Other

If there are other additional documents that you wish to pass to hiring authorities, you can attach them under this document type. In addition, some jobs may require specific documents outside of this list such as writing samples, which can be attached using the type of "other".


## Senior Executives

### Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs)

If you're applying to a Senior Executive job within the Senior Executive Service (SES) you must demonstrate you possess the [Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs)](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/senior-executive-service/executive-core-qualifications/){:target="_blank"}. The ECQs define the competencies needed to build a federal corporate culture that drives for results, serves customers, and builds successful teams and coalitions within and outside the organization. The ECQs are required for entry to the SES and are used by many departments and agencies in selection, performance management, and leadership development for executive positions.

The ECQ requirement only applies to jobs within the SES.  There may be other senior executive level jobs outside of the SES that require different qualifications.
