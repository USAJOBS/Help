Forms are a type of document that agencies often request and you may need to provide supplemental forms when applying to certain jobs. You can find a list of all required documents under the **Required Documents** section of the job announcement. These will most often be documents that you have created, such as your resume or work sample, or that have been given to you by another organization, such as a license, certificate, or reference.

## Standard forms

Agencies use standard forms for various employment and benefits program purposes. These forms have the abbreviation "SF" as part of the form name. Common standard forms include:

-   [SF-50 – Notification of Personnel Action](https://www.opm.gov/forms/standard-forms/){:target="\_blank"}(PDF, 335.25 KB)
-   [SF-15 – Application for 10-point Veterans Preference](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/SF15.pdf){:target="\_blank"}(PDF, 1.22 MB)
