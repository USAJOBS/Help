The applicant number indicates the number of people who started applying for a job through USAJOBS and continued to the hiring agency to finish the application. The number may not show completed applications.

## When does a job announcement list the number of applicants?

We provide the number of applicants for jobs you have applied for once they have the status [Reviewing Applications or Hiring Complete](../../../how-to/application/status/).

You will not see an applicant count on jobs you have applied for that are canceled or before the job closes to new applicants.

## Why do some jobs list the applicant count and not others?

Right now, agencies must choose to list the applicant count. Only agencies who have chosen this feature will show applicant counts.
