No, not all federal jobs require a security clearance. However, all federal positions require the candidate to undergo a suitability adjudication process to determine if the applicant is suitable for federal employment. In addition to meeting the qualifications of a job announcement, the federal government determines if an applicant is likely or not likely to carry out the duties of a federal job with appropriate integrity, efficiency and effectiveness.
