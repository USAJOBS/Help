Status candidates are current or former federal employees who have worked in the competitive service, in a <span data-term="Permanent Appointment">permanent appointment</span> for a total of three years of qualifying service. Sometimes this is also called having status or a career appointment.

If you have status, you're eligible for jobs that are open to **Federal employees—competitive service**. These are also known as merit promotion jobs.

Look for the **This job is open to section** in the job announcement.  If the job lists **Federal employee—competitive service**, you’re most likely eligible. You can also look at the **Clarification from agency**—it might say status candidates or merit promotion.
