"Status candidates" are current or former federal employees who have worked in the competitive service, in a <span data-term="Permanent Appointment">permanent appointment</span> for a total of three years of qualifying service. Sometimes this is also called having 'status' or a 'career appointment'.

If you have status, you're eligible for jobs that are open to **Federal employees - Competitive service**. These are also known as merit promotion jobs. 

Look for the **This job is open to section** in the job announcement.  If the job lists “Federal employee-Competitive service”, you’re most likely eligible. You can also look at the **Clarification from agency** or the **Who may apply** sections—it might say “Status candidates” or “Merit promotionon".
