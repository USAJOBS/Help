## Should I upgrade my browser?

If you can upgrade your browser, you should do so. Older browsers can be:

* Slower.
* More likely to crash.
* Unable to display current web technologies.
* More vulnerable to viruses, spyware, malware, and other security issues.

New browsers are more likely to be:

* More secure.
* Faster at loading pages.
* Less likely to crash.
* Able to automatically update to the latest version or notify you that an update is available.
