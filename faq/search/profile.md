Your USAJOBS profile provides us with important information about you, your background and your work preferences. You must at least complete the required sections of your profile if you want to apply to a job on USAJOBS, but there are benefits to completing all sections of your profile.

## Contact and Eligibility

We use your Contact and Eligibility information when you apply to a job – we auto-complete certain fields in the job application process with this information.

### Preferences

We use your Preferences to:

1.	Improve your job search results. When you’re signed in, and start a job search, we’ll look for jobs that match your preferences, such as your desired work location, schedule, travel, and more.

2.	Help agencies match your work preferences with the job opportunities they’re looking to fill – we only use this if you’ve made your resume searchable.

### Demographics

We use your Demographics information to find out if our recruitment efforts are reaching all segments of the population, consistent with federal equal employment opportunity laws. Completing the demographics section is optional. We don’t provide your demographics to anyone involved in reviewing your application or to the public and we don’t keep this information in your personnel file.
