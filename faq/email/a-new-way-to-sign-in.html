<p>
  In a couple of weeks, USAJOBS is changing the way you’ll sign in, making it easier and more secure.
</p>
<h4>What do I need to do?</h4>
<p>
  For now, sign into your USAJOBS account to make sure it’s up-to-date. If everything looks okay, you don’t need to do anything else just yet.
</p>
<h4>When will the change happen?</h4>
<p>
  In a couple of weeks we’ll make the change. At that time, we’ll send you another email telling you what you need to do.
