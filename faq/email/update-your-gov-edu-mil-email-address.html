  In a couple of weeks, USAJOBS is changing the way you’ll sign in, making it easier and more secure.
</p>
<h3>What do I need to do?</h3>
<p>
  It looks like you’re using a .gov, .edu, or .mil email address as your primary email for USAJOBS. Before we make the changes to our sign in process, we recommend you update your primary email address to use a personal email address instead of a .gov, .mil or .edu email address.
</p>
<h3>
  Why shouldn’t I use a .gov, .edu, or .mil email address?
</h3>
<p>
  If you use a .gov, .edu, or .mil email as your primary email address, and then you leave your government or military position or school, you won’t have access to that email address anymore. Without access to that email address, it will be much harder to verify who you are, if you need to reset your password. You also won’t get emails about jobs and other important USAJOBS information.
</p>
<p>
  Using a personal email address that you control (such as a Gmail account), is the best way to make sure you can always get to important USAJOBS messaging and profile information.
