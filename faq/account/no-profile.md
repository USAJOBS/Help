After you create your login.gov account (on the login.gov website), youâ€™ll see a button called **Continue to USAJOBS**. You must click **Continue to USAJOBS** to link your USAJOBS profile.

If we can't find your profile information, you'll be signed in as **Guest** on USAJOBS.

### If you see "Guest", but think you have an existing USAJOBS profile

You might be signed in as "Guest" because you entered a different email address (from what we have on record) when you created your login.gov account. Look under the "Already have a profile?" section and click **Find existing profile**. We'll walk you through a few steps to help you find your profile.

If you're still having issues linking to your profile, contact us by filling out the form below.
