After you create your login.gov account, click **Continue to USAJOBS** to link your USAJOBS profile. 

If we can’t find your profile information, you’ll be signed in as **Guest**. If you think you have a USAJOBS profile, look under the "Already have a profile?" section and click **Find existing profile**. We'll walk you through a few steps to find your profile.  

If you’re still having issues linking to your profile, contact us by filling out the form below.
