After you create your login.gov account, click **Continue to USAJOBS** to link your USAJOBS profile. If we can’t find your profile information, you’ll be signed in as **Guest**. If you think you have a USAJOBS profile, first try the **Already have a profile?** option. We'll walk you through a few steps to find your profile.  If you’re still having issues linking to your profile, contact us by filling out the form below.
