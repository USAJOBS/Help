## What is login.gov?
login.gov is a service that offers secure and private online access to government programs, such as federal benefits, services and applications. With a login.gov account, you can sign into multiple government websites with the same username and password.

## Why is USAJOBS using login.gov?
login.gov uses two-factor authentication, and stronger passwords, that meet new [National Institute of Standards of Technology](https://www.nist.gov/) requirements for secure validation and verification. By using login.gov, you’ll get an extra layer of security to help protect your USAJOBS account against password compromises.

## What will happen to my USAJOBS account?
Nothing will happen to the information stored in your USAJOBS account and profile.  You’ll keep all of your applications, saved searches and saved jobs.

Once you set up a login.gov account, we’ll link it back to your USAJOBS profile. The only difference is you’ll use your login.gov email address and password to sign into USAJOBS.


## What do I need to do?
Once USAJOBS starts using login.gov, you will receive an email from us asking you to set up a login.gov account.  Follow the steps in the email, or we'll prompt you the next time you sign into USAJOBS.

login.gov will walk you through each step of account set-up, but here’s a few things to know:

1.	You’ll need to enter an email address to start the account set up¬–use the same email address you use for USAJOBS (either your primary or secondary email address). 
2.  You'll need a working phone number (mobile or landline).
3.	You’ll only need to create the login.gov account once.
4.	You’ll use your login.gov email address and password whenever you want to sign into USAJOBS.

Once you’ve finished setting up your login.gov account, you’ll go back to USAJOBS to finish the process.  Double check your USAJOBS Profile to make sure all of your information is accurate.

## What email address do I use to create a login.gov account?
To keep your USAJOBS profile information, you need to use your primary or secondary USAJOBS email when you create your login.gov account. When you use the same email that you use for USAJOBS, we'll automatically link your USAJOBS profile to the login.gov account. 
If you use a different email address when signing up for login.gov, we won't be able to automatically link your profile. But, we can use your USAJOBS primary or secondary email address to help you recover your profile.

We recommend you don’t use a .gov, .mil or .edu email address. Instead, you should use a non-government email address when you create your login.gov account.

[You also can’t use an email address you share with someone else](#can-i-share-a-logingov-account-with-another-person).

### Why shouldn’t I use a .gov, .edu, or .mil email address?
If you use a .gov, .edu, or .mil email as your primary email address, and then you leave your government or military position or school, you won’t have access to that email address anymore. Without access to that email address, it will be much harder to verify who you are, if you need to reset your password. You also won’t get emails about jobs and other important USAJOBS information.

Using a personal email address that you control (such as a Gmail account), is the best way to make sure you can always get to important USAJOBS messaging and profile information.


## What if I currently use a .gov, .mil, or .edu email address for my USAJOBS primary email?
If you currently use a .gov, .mil, or .edu email for your USAJOBS primary email, and you don’t have a secondary email address, you should update your USAJOBS account (before you create a login.gov account) to use a personal (non-government) email address. Once you update your USAJOBS primary email address, you can create the login.gov account.

## Can I use a different email address from my USAJOBS email address, when setting up my login.gov account?
You can change your email with login.gov AFTER you get through the account set-up process.

## Can I share a login.gov account with another person?
No. Each person needs their own login.gov account.  If you’ve shared your USAJOBS account in the past, with a spouse or child, you can no longer do this with login.gov. Each person must set up their own account, with their own personal email address (not an email that you share with someone else).
