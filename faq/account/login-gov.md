## What is login.gov?
login.gov is a service that offers secure and private online access to government programs, such as federal benefits, services and applications. With a login.gov account, you can sign into multiple government websites with the same username and password.

## Why is USAJOBS using login.gov?
login.gov uses two-factor authentication, and stronger passwords, that meet new [National Institute of Standards of Technology](https://www.nist.gov/) requirements for secure validation and verification. By using login.gov, you’ll get an extra layer of security to help protect your USAJOBS account against password compromises.

## What will happen to my USAJOBS account?
Nothing will happen to the information stored in your USAJOBS account and profile.  You will keep all of your applications, saved searches and saved jobs.

Once you set up a login.gov account, we will link it back to your USAJOBS account. The only difference is you’ll use your login.gov username and password to sign into USAJOBS.

## What do I need to do?
Once USAJOBS starts using login.gov, you will receive an email from us asking you to set up a login.gov account.  Follow the steps in the email, or we will prompt you the next time you sign into USAJOBS. 

login.gov will walk you through each step of account set-up, but here’s what you can expect:

1.	You’ll need to enter an email address¬–use the same email address you use for USAJOBS (either your primary or secondary email address). 
2.	You’ll have to enter a phone number¬–it can be a mobile or landline number.
3.	You’ll get a security code either through text or phone call–this is the ‘two-factor authentication’ piece.
4.	You’ll create a personal key–this your backup if you forget your password or lose your phone.

Once you’ve finished setting up your login.gov account, you’ll go back to USAJOBS to finish the process.  Double check your USAJOBS Profile to make sure all of your information is accurate.

## What email address do I use to create a login.gov account?
To keep your USAJOBS profile information, you need to use your primary or secondary USAJOBS email when you create your login.gov account. When you use the same email that you use for USAJOBS, we'll automatically link your USAJOBS account to the login.gov account. If you use a different email address, you'll have to enter your old USAJOBS credentials to get your profile back.

Don’t use a .gov or .mil email address. You must use a non-government email address when you create your login.gov account. 

## What if I currently use a .gov or .mil email address for my USAJOBS primary email?
If you currently use a .gov or .mil email for your USAJOBS primary email, and you don’t have a secondary email address, you’ll need to update your USAJOBS account (before you create a login.gov account) to use a non-government email address. Once you update your USAJOBS primary email address, you can create the login.gov account. 

## Can I use a different email address from my USAJOBS email adderss, when setting up my login.gov account?

You can change your email with login.gov AFTER you get through the account set-up process.
