No. You must have your own login.gov account to create a USAJOBS profile and apply to jobs.

When you create a login.gov account, you must use your own personal email address—you can’t use an email address that you share with someone else, like a spouse or child.  And, we can only link one login.gov account with one USAJOBS profile.
