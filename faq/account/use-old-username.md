You can't sign into login.gov using your old USAJOBS username and password. If you haven't already done so, you must [create a new account](https://www.usajobs.gov/Applicant/ProfileDashboard/Home/){:target="_blank"} with login.gov.

You only need to create a login.gov account once. Login.gov will walk you through each step to create your account, but you need to:

*	Use your existing USAJOBS email address when login.gov asks you to enter an email address—this will help us link your USAJOBS profile to your new login.gov account.
*	Create a new password—don’t use your old USAJOBS password.

[Learn more about login.gov](/login-gov) and [create your account.](https://www.usajobs.gov/Applicant/ProfileDashboard/Home/){:target="_blank"}.
