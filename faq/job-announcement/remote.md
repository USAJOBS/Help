A remote job in the federal government is one where you are not expected to report to an official agency worksite regularly. Instead, you will work from your home or other alternative worksite either within or outside of the commuting area of your agency’s official worksite.  

## How do I know a job is remote?

Under the **Location** header in the **Overview** section of the job announcement, we will list the remote job location as **Anywhere in the U.S. (remote job)**. 

In your search results, the location information, including whether a job is remote or not, is listed under agency name.  

### Am I expected to come to an office?  

As a remote worker, you may occasionally travel to an office for training or other reasons, but you will not regularly commute to an office for your day-to-day work.  

### How am I paid?  

All federal workers’ salaries have a base rate and a locality adjustment for the area where you work. The locality adjustment of a remote job is based on the area where you regularly work—your home or alternative worksite.

### What if I want to work a hybrid position where I can work in an office and from home?  

Many federal jobs offer the option to work from home and from an office location. We call this telework. The in-office work schedule and telework frequency depend on the agency and the job duties.  

A telework-eligible job is not the same as a remote position, which is a position where you would regularly work from home or an approved alternative worksite.

### Will some jobs require me to work hours in a specific time zone? 

Yes, some government jobs may require you to work hours in a time zone that is different from the one you live in. Review the job announcement to understand the job requirements before applying.
