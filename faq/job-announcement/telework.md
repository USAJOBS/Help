Many federal jobs offer the option to work from home and from an office location. Sometimes this is referred to as a hybrid schedule or hybrid work, but the federal government calls this telework. How often you are required to report to an office depends on the agency and the job duties.  

Telework-eligible jobs are not the same as remote positions, which is a position where you work from home or an approved alternative worksite without a requirement to regularly go into an office. Review the job announcement to understand the requirements before applying to a job.  

## How to find jobs that offer telework 

To search for a telework-eligible job: 

1. Go to **More filters**. 
2. Scroll to **Locations**. 
3. Select the **Offers telework** checkbox.
