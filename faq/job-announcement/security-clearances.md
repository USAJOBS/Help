If hired for a federal job, you must at least go through a basic background check to make sure you’re reliable, trustworthy, and suitable for the job. The background check process starts after you accept a job offer.

The hiring agency will ask you for the necessary personal information to start the background investigation process.  The amount of information you’ll need to give depends on the job.  

## What type of information will I need to provide?
Regardless of the type of background check, you will at least need to answer questions about where you've lived, worked, went to school, and any military history or police records. You’ll also need to have your fingerprints taken if you’ve never worked for the Federal Government. 

## Public Trust
Public Trust is a type of background investigation, but **it is not a security clearance**. Depending on the job, you must complete either the [Standard Form 85 (SF85)](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf85.pdf) or [85P (SF85P)](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf85p.pdf) questionnaire.

## Security Clearance
Some jobs require a security clearance. The security clearance level depends on the type of access to classified information and secure facilities that you’ll need to perform your job.

For jobs that require a security clearance, you’ll need to provide at least 10 years of personal information¬ and maybe more.  You’ll need to complete the [Standard Form 86 (SF86)](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf86-non508.pdf).

Read the **Background and security clearance** section of the job announcement to see what security level is required. If you have questions about the background investigation process, contact the hiring agency for the job.
