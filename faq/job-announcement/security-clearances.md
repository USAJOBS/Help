Every person hired for a federal job must at least go through a basic background check to review your criminal and credit history. The Federal Government requires the background check to make sure you’re “reliable, trustworthy, of good conduct and character, and loyal to the United States.” 

Some jobs require additional background checks or a security clearance. It all depends on the type of access you’ll have to sensitive and national security information. A job that requires access to highly sensitive information will require a higher security clearance level and a more extensive background investigation.

Read the Background and security clearance section of the job announcement to see what security level is required.

## Public Trust

All jobs require at least this level of security. Public Trust is not a security clearance, but it does require a basic background investigation to make sure you’re suitable for the job. You must complete the Standard Form (SF) 85P questionnaire.


## Confidential

Gives access to information or material that may cause damage to national security if you disclose that information without authorization. A confidential security clearance is reinvestigated every 15 years.

## Secret

Gives access to information or material that may cause serious damage to national security if you disclose that information without authorization. A secret security clearance is reinvestigated every 10 years.

## Top Secret

Gives access to information or material that may cause exceptionally grave damage to national security if you disclose that information without authorization. A top-secret security clearance is reinvestigated every five years.

## Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI)

Gives access to all intelligence information and material that require special controls for restricted handling within compartmented channels.
