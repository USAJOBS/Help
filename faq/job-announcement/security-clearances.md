Every person hired for a federal job must at least go through a basic background check to review your criminal and credit history. The Federal Government requires the background check to make sure you’re reliable, trustworthy, and suitable for the job.

Some jobs require a more extensive background check or a security clearance. It all depends on the type of access you’ll have to sensitive and national security information. A job that requires access to highly sensitive information will require a higher security clearance level and a more extensive background investigation.

Read the Background and security clearance section of the job announcement to see what security level is required.

## Background Investigations
A basic background investigation usually involves a finger printing process and a basic check of your criminal and credit history.

### Public Trust 
Public Trust is a more extensive background investigation, but it is not a security clearance. Most federal jobs that involve policy-making, public safety and health, law enforcement duties, managing finances, dealing with compliance or managing major programs, require a “Public Trust” background investigation. The background investigation starts after you accept a job offer. You will need to provide
references from people who know you and answer questions about where you've lived, worked and any military history or police records.

## Security Clearances

### Confidential
Gives access to information or material that may cause damage to national security, if you reveal that information without authorization. A confidential security clearance is reinvestigated every 15 years. 

### Secret 
Gives access to information or material that may cause serious damage to national security if you reveal that information without authorization. A secret security clearance is reinvestigated every 10 years.

### Top Secret
Gives access to information or material that may cause exceptionally grave damage to national security, if you reveal that information without authorization. A top-secret security clearance is reinvestigated every five years.

### Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI)
Gives access to all intelligence information and material that require special controls for restricted handling within compartmented channels.

### Q Sensitive
Gives access to Special Nuclear Material (SNM) category 1. A person with a Q sensitive clearance could have access to nuclear weapons information and revealing this information could cause exceptionally grave damage to the nation.

### Q Non-sensitive 
Gives access to Special Nuclear Material (SNM) category 2. The higher the SNM category, the more readily the material could be converted to a nuclear explosive device. 

### L Clearance 
Gives access to Secret National Security Information and to Special Nuclear Material (SNM) categories 3 and 4, but not to Secret Restricted Data or SNM categories 1 and 2.  A person with L clearance may have access only to Confidential Restricted Data, or may have access to both Confidential and Secret FRD and NSI. The background investigation for an L clearance is much less extensive than for a Q clearance. However, both Q and L clearances require the same standards of personal conduct. If a background investigation uncovered something that would deny a Q clearance, it would also deny an L clearance.
