A bargaining unit position is a position that is represented by a labor union. More than half of the Federal government is covered by bargaining units, allowing unions to negotiate over various conditions of employment. They don’t generally negotiate compensation or other matters deemed to be in management’s sole prerogative.

You must be in a recognized bargaining unit to join the union. However, you do not need to be a dues-paying union member if you are in a bargaining unit.

A job announcement may indicate: "This is a bargaining unit position".

### Appeal rights

A bargaining unit position may be required to use a negotiated grievance procedure.
