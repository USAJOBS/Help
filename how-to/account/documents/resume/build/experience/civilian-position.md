Federal experience includes positions you have held as a civilian employee paid by an agency of the Federal government. The pay plan, series, and grade fields refer to Executive Branch <span data-term="Competitive Position">competitive positions</span> and are not mandatory fields. If your experience does not fit, simply leave those fields blank.

Active duty military members or experience working for a private contractor of the U.S. government do not qualify as Federal positions for this purpose.
