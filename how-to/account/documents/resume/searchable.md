Making your resume searchable adds it to the USAJOBS Resume Mining collection. Resume Mining helps HR specialists and hiring managers from federal agencies look for applicants (with a USAJOBS profile) for their job announcements. 

* Only one of your resumes can be made searchable at a time.
* Only certain formats are searchable including Word, text based pdfs, text files and resumes created using our Resume Builder tool.
* Your resume will only remain searchable for 18 months unless it is renewed.

To make your resume searchable:

1. Sign into your USAJOBS profile.
2. Go to **Documents**--your resumes will appear in your Documents.
2. Click the **Searchable** checkbox on the resume you want to make searchable.

If you want to remove your resume from the Resume Mining collection unselect the **Searchable** checkbox.
