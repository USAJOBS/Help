If you have a USAJOBS profile, you can upload and manage your resume, required forms, and other documents.

1. Sign into USAJOBS.
2. Click the **Documents** link located in the left-hand navigation.
3. Select **Resumes** or **Other Documents** located at the top of the page.

## Manage your resumes

You can upload and store up to five resumes in your profile. Here is what you can do:

### Edit your resume

There are two ways you can edit your resume(s).

1. If you created your resume with the Resume Builder tool, you can edit it directly in the tool.
2. If you uploaded your resume from your computer, you must re-upload the edited document.[Learn how to edit your resume](resume/edit/).

### Delete a resume

You may need to delete a resume if you want to upload a new resume, but already have five in your profile.  When you delete a resume, it will be completely removed from your profile.

### Make a resume searchable

You can make your resume searchable, so your profile and resume will be visible to recruiters searching our resume bank. [Learn more about making a resume searchable](resume/searchable/).

### Upload a resume or create a resume

You can [upload a resume](resume/upload/) or [use our Resume Builder to build one](resume/build/). Resumes must be less than 3MB in size. You can upload in the following formats:

* GIF
* JPG
* JPEG
* PNG
* RTF
* PDF
* TXT
* Word (.doc or .docx)

If you upload a resume, we recommend writing your resume using Word because you can make it searchable to recruiters in our resume bank.

## Manage forms and other documents

You may need to upload forms or other documents, such as a [DD-214](../../../faq/application/documents/#dd-214), [SF-15](../../../faq/application/documents/#sf-15), [cover letters](../../../faq/application/documents/#cover-letter) or [transcripts](../../../faq/application/documents/#transcripts), as part of the application process. You can edit, delete, and upload documents.

All documents must be less than 3MB in size and in one of the following document formats:

* GIF
* JPG
* JPEG
* PNG
* RTF
* PDF
* TXT
* Word (.doc or .docx)

If you make changes to a document, you'll need to upload the updated version of the file to your profile.  However, some forms canâ€™t be edited, except for the file name or document type.
