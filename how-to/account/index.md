You need to [create a login.gov account](https://www.usajobs.gov/Applicant/ProfileDashboard/Home/) to sign into USAJOBS and access your profile information. <strong>Your old USAJOBS username and password won't work anymore.
</strong>

You need to:

1. Create a login.gov account—you only need to do this once.
2. Enter an email address - use the same email address you use for USAJOBS (your primary or secondary email address), if you have an existing profile with us.
3. Create a new password.
4. Select your first method of authentication—having another way to sign in keeps your account more secure than using only a password. You can choose between text messages, phone calls, an authentication application, a security key, or backup codes. Government employees can also use their PIV or CAC cards.
5. Select a backup method of authentication—you need to select a backup method, in case you don’t have access to your first choice (for example you don’t have access to your phone).

Once you create a login.gov account, you'll come back to USAJOBS to link to your existing profile, or create a new profile if you don't have one. <b>You only need to create your account and link it once</b>.  [Get step by step instructions on creating an account](https://login.gov/help/creating-an-account/how-do-i-create-an-account-with-logingov/) at login.gov.

If you have limited access to a phone or cell service, you can [set up an authentication app or use a free text messaging app](limited-access/).

## Do I have to create a login.gov account every time I want to sign into USAJOBS?
No. You only need to create a login.gov account and link it to your USAJOBS profile once.  Once that’s done, you use the same login.gov email address and password, plus one of the two-factor authentication methods you set up, every time you sign into USAJOBS.
