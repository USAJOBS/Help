You need to [create a login.gov account](https://www.usajobs.gov/Access/Transition) to sign into USAJOBS and access your profile information. <strong>Your old USAJOBS username and password won't work anymore.
</strong>

You'll need to:

*	Create a login.gov account—you only need to do this once.
*	Enter an email address - use the same email address you use for USAJOBS (your primary or secondary email address), if you have an existing profile with us.
*	Create a new password.
*	Have a working phone number (mobile or landline) or an authentication application installed on a device—login.gov will send you a one-time security code..

Once you create a login.gov account, you'll come back to USAJOBS to link to your existing profile, or create a new profile if you don't have one.

If you have limited access to a phone or cell service, you can [set up an authentication app or use a free text messaging app](/limited-access/).

[Create your account](https://login.usajobs.gov/Access/Transition/){:target="_blank"}.
