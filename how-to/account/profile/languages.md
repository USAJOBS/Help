You can add languages that you speak, write or read fluently or proficiently, to your profile. You can add more than one language.

## Why add languages?
Showing that youâ€™re proficient in more than one language can set you apart from other applicants. If you make your resume and profile searchable, recruiters can find you based on your language skills. 

To add a language:

1.	Select the language from the drop down.
2.	Select if your proficiency with the language is novice, intermediate or advanced.
3.	Click **Save language**.
4.	Repeat these steps for each language you want to add.
