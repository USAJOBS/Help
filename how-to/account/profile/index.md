You need to create and complete a profile to apply to jobs, save searches and save jobs. But first, you need to create a login.gov account.

To create and complete a profile:

1. [Create a login.gov account](https://www.usajobs.gov/Applicant/ProfileDashboard/Home/) and click **Continue to USAJOBS** at the end. You’ll go back to USAJOBS.
2. Click **Create Profile**.
3. Follow the steps to complete your Contact, Citizenship and Experience information—you must complete all of the required fields.
4. Add your **Preferences** and fill out as many optional fields as you can—we can use this information to improve your job search results.


## Applying to a job and see this message?

> You must complete the required sections of your profile before you can submit this application.
