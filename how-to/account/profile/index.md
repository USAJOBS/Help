You need to create and complete a profile to apply to jobs, save searches and save jobs. But first, you need to create a login.gov account.

To create and complete a profile:

1. [Create a login.gov account](https://www.usajobs.gov/Applicant/ProfileDashboard/Home/) and click **Continue to USAJOBS** at the end. You’ll go back to USAJOBS.
2. Click Complete profile.
3. Complete your required information—Contact Information, Citizenship and Selective Service information, Federal Service and Military Service. 
4. Click **Create my profile**.  

Once you complete the required information in your profile, you can apply for jobs. However, you can enhance your profile by filling out the optional information—we use this information to improve your job search results 

You can also make your resume and profile searchable. Making your resume searchable adds it to the USAJOBS resume bank. HR specialists and hiring managers from federal agencies use the resume bank to look for people to fill their job vacancies.
