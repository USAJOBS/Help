Some federal jobs require that you have a college degree or specific coursework. You can find these requirements in the **Qualifications** section of the job announcement.

If you’re applying to a job with education requirements, you must include the required education and coursework information in your resume.  As you fill out your education information, you need to include: 

* Your degree (s)—it must be from an accredited academic institution. 
* The highest academic level you completed—include post-secondary courses, even if you don’t have a degree.
* A transcript if you’re using education to qualify for a job—the hiring agency may ask you for an unofficial transcript during the application process and an official transcript later.

You can add up to 50 entries for your education in your profile, or in our resume builder. If you want to add more, you’ll need to delete an existing entry.

## Education from an accredited academic institution

You must provide documentation or proof that your degree(s) is from a school accredited by an accrediting institution recognized by the Secretary, U.S. Department of Education, or that your education meets the other provisions outlined in the OPM Operating Manual.
If you completed your education outside of the U.S., you must provide proof its equivalent to accredited U.S. education programs.
