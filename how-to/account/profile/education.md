Some Federal positions have education requirements, such as a specific degree or coursework. You can find these requirements in the Qualifications section of the job announcement.

If you’re applying to a job with education requirements, you must include the required education and coursework information in your resume. Your degree must be from an accredited academic institution. When education is used to qualify for a position, a Federal agency will ask you to provide a transcript when you apply to a job or upon tentative selection. If you have no degree, but have completed post-secondary courses, you should still provide that information.

## Academic Level and School Information

You must provide documentation or proof that your degree(s) is from a school accredited by an accrediting institution recognized by the Secretary, U.S. Department of Education, or that your education meets the other provisions outlined in the OPM Operating Manual.

Education completed outside of the U.S. must be equivalent to accredited U.S. education programs.
