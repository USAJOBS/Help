In the **Eligibility** section of your profile, you must provide information about your current or former federal employment.

## Please select the statement below which best reflects your federal employment status (if applicable).

_I am not and have never been a federal civilian employee._

Select this option if you’ve never worked for the federal government.  Working for a federal contractor does not qualify as working for the federal government.

_I am currently a federal civilian employee._

Select this option if you’re a current employee of:

* The Executive, Legislative, or Judicial Branches
* An independent agency

_I am a former federal civilian employee with reinstatement eligibility._

Select this option if you’re a former federal employee who held a career or career-conditional appointment with [reinstatement eligibility](#reinstatement).

_I am a former federal civilian employee but do not have reinstatement eligibility._

Select this option if you're a **former** federal civilian employee without reinstatement eligibility.

### What is reinstatement?

You may be eligible for reinstatement if you held a career or career-conditional appointment in the federal government. Reinstatement allows former federal employees to re-enter the federal competitive service workforce without competing with the public.

## Are you a current federal civilian employee serving under a Veterans' Recruitment Appointment (VRA)?

The Veterans’ Recruitment Appointment (VRA) is a hiring authority that federal agencies can use to hire eligible veterans without competing with the public. [Learn more about VRA](https://fedshirevets.gov/job/shav/index.aspx){:target="_blank"}.

Select **Yes** if you’re a current federal employee hired under a VRA.

## Indicate the pay plan, series, grade level/pay band of the highest permanent graded position you ever held as a federal civilian employee.

You must provide information about your pay, series and grade level if you’re a current or former federal employee. This information can be found on a recent [SF-50](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdfimage/sf50.pdf){:target="_blank"} (Notification of Personnel Action).

## Are you a retiree receiving a federal annuity?

## Have you accepted a buyout from a federal agency within the past 5 years?
Some federal agencies may offer a buyout, also called a Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment (VSIP), to employees if the agency needs to downsize or restructure.

If you’ve accepted a buyout from a federal agency and then accept a new paid position with a federal agency within 5 years of the buyout, you’ll be required to pay the entire amount back to the agency that gave you the buyout (before you start the new job).
