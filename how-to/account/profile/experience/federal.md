Select this option if you’re a former federal employee who held a career or career-conditional appointment with [reinstatement eligibility](#reinstatement).

_I am a former federal civilian employee but do not have reinstatement eligibility._

You may be eligible for reinstatement if you held a career or career-conditional appointment in the federal government.
