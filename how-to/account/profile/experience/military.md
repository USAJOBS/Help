In your profile, you must answer a few questions about your current or past military service.

## Have you served in the U.S. Armed Forces or are you a family member eligible for derived preference?

Select **No** if you’ve never served in the U.S. Armed Forces or you’re not a family member eligible for [derived preference](#what-is-derived-preference). If you answer no, the remaining military questions will disappear and you will not have to answer them.

### What is derived preference?

Derived preference is when a spouse, widow or widower, or parent of a veteran is eligible to claim Veterans’ Preference when the veteran is unable to use it. You’re not eligible for derived preference if you have any other relationship with the veteran or if the veteran is living and is qualified for federal employment.

## Do you claim Veterans’ Preference?

Veterans’ Preference gives eligible veterans preference over many other applicants in the hiring process. You can use Veterans’ Preference when applying to permanent and temporary positions in both the competitive and excepted service (of the executive branch). However, Veterans’ Preference does not guarantee you a job.

You must select one of the following options:

_0-point preference - Sole Survivorship Preference (SSP)_

Select this option if you’re the only surviving child in a family where your mother or father or sibling(s) died, is captured or missing in action or is 100 percent disabled, while on active duty and NOT by intentional misconduct or willful neglect.

## Are you a veteran who was separated from the Armed Forces under honorable conditions after completing an initial continuous tour of duty of at least 3 years (may have been released just short of 3 years) (VEOA)?

Select **Yes** if you’re a veteran who has served at least three continuous years and was discharged under honorable conditions. You may be eligible for a special hiring authority called Veterans Employment Opportunity Act of 1998 (VEOA).

### What is Veterans Employment Opportunity Act of 1998 (VEOA)?

VEOA is a hiring authority used to fill permanent, competitive service jobs. Under VEOA, eligible veterans can apply to jobs that are only open to “status” employees (i.e. jobs that are not offered to candidates outside of the federal government).
