The password you use to sign into USAJOBS is your login.gov password. To change or reset your password, go to login.gov and read their help pages:

* [How do I change my login.gov password?](https://login.gov/help/changing-settings/change-my-password/){:target="_blank"}

* [What do I do if my password doesn’t work or I forget it?](https://login.gov/help/signing-in/forgot-my-password/){:target="_blank"}

Good news—you no longer need to answer security questions. If you forget your password, go to login.gov and read their help page:
