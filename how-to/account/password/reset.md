The password you use to sign into USAJOBS is your login.gov password. To change or reset your password, go to login.gov and read their help pages:

* [How do I change my login.gov password?](https://login.gov/help/changing-settings/how-do-i-change-my-password/)

* [What do I do if my password doesn’t work or I forget it?](https://login.gov/help/signing-in/what-do-i-do-if-my-password-doesnt-work-or-i-forget-it/)
