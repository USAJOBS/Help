When you create a login.gov account, you’ll be asked to enter a phone number where you can receive a security code. You can only receive the security code by SMS (text message), if you’re using an international phone number.

To enter an international phone number:

1. Select the country where your phone number is located - this will prepopulate the country code into the phone number field.
2. Check the phone number field to make sure the correct country code is showing.
3. Enter the remaining phone number digits into the phone number field - **DO NOT** enter the country code again and **DO NOT** enter the international prefix/dial out code (i.e. 00, 010, 011).
4. Click **Send security code** and follow the remaining steps.

If you have issues using an international phone number, because of limited access or cell service, you can [use an authentication application](../limited-access/) instead (once you create your login.gov account).
