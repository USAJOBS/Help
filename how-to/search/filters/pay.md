You can filter your search results by salary or pay grade.

## Salary
Typically there is a minimum and maximum salary for every job – federal agencies determine a salary based on their pay setting rules (the pay grade or other pay schedule) and your qualifications.

Each job announcement will display a starting salary.  When you filter by a salary range, we’ll show you all of the jobs that have a starting salary within that range. You may see multiple GS grades and pay schedules in your results. 

## Hourly wage
Some federal jobs offer hourly wages. When you filter by salary, we convert the hourly wages to annual salaries and show you any hourly jobs that fall within your salary range.

## Pay Grade
A General Schedule (GS) pay grade is one of many pay systems in the Federal Government. A GS pay grade is a rate of basic pay based on the specific level of work or range of difficulty, responsibility, and qualifications. 

The GS pay schedule has 15 pay grades and 10 steps in each grade. A salary can vary within a pay grade depending if you’re at step 1 (the starting salary) or step 10 (the maximum salary). If you’re new to the government, your pay will likely be set at the starting salary for the pay grade for which you are selected.

When you search by a GS grade or range of grades, we’ll show you jobs that match the grade(s) and any non-GS jobs that are equivalent in salary. For example, to search for jobs that fall within the GS 9 and GS 12 levels, click **GS 9** and then click **GS 12**. We’ll show you all jobs that are GS 9, GS 10, GS 11 or GS 12.
