You can filter your search results by salary or pay grade.

## Salary
Each job announcement will display a starting salary.  When you filter by a salary range, we’ll show you all of the jobs that have a starting salary within that range. You may see multiple GS grades and pay schedules in your results. 

## Hourly wage
When you filter by salary, we convert the hourly wages to annual salaries and show you any hourly jobs that fall within your salary range.

## Pay Grade
When you search by a GS grade or range of grades, we’ll show you jobs that match the grade(s) and any non-GS jobs that are equivalent in salary. For example, to search for jobs that fall within the GS 9 and GS 12 levels, click **GS 9** and then click **GS 12**. We’ll show you all jobs that are GS 9, GS 10, GS 11 or GS 12.
