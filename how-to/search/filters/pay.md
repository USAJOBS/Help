Use this filter to limit results to one or more pay grade range.

## Salary Range

Use **salary** to search for jobs that fall within a specific salary range.

Salary range is the minimum and maximum amount of pay within a pay grade or pay band for that position. Federal agencies offer pay for a position depending on their pay setting rules and your qualifications. If youâ€™re new to the government, your pay will likely be set at the minimum salary for the pay grade or band for which you are selected.


## Pay Grade/General Schedule

A pay grade is a rate of basic pay associated with a specific level of work or range of difficulty, responsibility, and qualification requirements. The GS pay schedule has 15 pay grades and 10 steps in each grade covering more than 400 occupations.

Use **pay grade** (GS) to look for jobs that fall within a specific pay grade range. For example, to search for positions that fall within the GS-9 and GS-12 levels, select 9 as the low value and 12 as the high value.

The Federal Government classifies job announcements by the General Schedule (GS) pay system as well as other pay systems. In your search results, you may see jobs that are outside of the GS pay system, but equivalent in salary to GS positions.
