A remote job in the federal government is one where you are not expected to report to an official agency worksite regularly. Instead, you will work from your home or other alternative worksite either within or outside of the commuting area of your agencyâ€™s official worksite.  

## How to filter results by remote jobs 

To search for remote jobs: 

1. Enter remote in the **Location** search box at the top of any page. You may have to click on the **Search** icon, at the top of the page, to display the **Location** box. 
2. Select from the auto-populated choices. 
3. Click **Search**. 

Your filter choice will display above your search results. 

### How to filter remote jobs using search filters 

You can choose to only show remote jobs or exclude remote jobs from your search. Go to **More filters** to change the filter under **Remote jobs**. 

To remove a remote filter, click on the x next to the filter you want to remove. Your search results will update every time you add or remove a filter.
