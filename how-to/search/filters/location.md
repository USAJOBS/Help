To search for a job by location:

1.	Enter a city, county, state, zip code, country or type remote in the **Location** search box at the top of any page. You may have to click on the **Search icon**, at the top of the page, to display the **Location** box.
2.	Keep typing the location or select from the auto-populated choices.
3.	Click **Search**.

Your location(s) will display above your search results.  

## Add and remove locations
You can search on multiple locations at the same timeâ€”just enter another location in the **Location** search box (you can only enter one at a time). You can search by city, county, state, zip code, country or by typing remote. 

The locations will appear above your search results. To remove a location, click on the **x** next to the location you want to remove. Your search results will update every time you add or remove a location. 

## Change the distance within a location
When you search by a city, we automatically show you jobs within a 25-mile radius. Go to **More Filters** to change the radius. We do not use a radius if you search by state or country.

## Find jobs with relocation assistance
Some jobs offer relocation assistance. Go to **More Filters** and select the **Offers relocation assistance** checkbox.

## Find remote work jobs 

Some jobs allow you to work at your home or an approved alternative location away from the agency worksite. These jobs do not require you to work at an official agency worksite. Remote jobs are automatically included in job search results unless you specifically exclude them.  

To only show remote jobs:  

1. Go to **More filters**. 
2. Go to **Remote jobs**. 
3. Select the **Only show remote jobs** checkbox. 

To exclude remote jobs:  

1. Go to **More filters**.
2. Go to **remote jobs**.
3. Select the **Exclude remote jobs** checkbox.

## Find jobs that offer telework

Many federal jobs offer the option to work from home and from an office location. Sometimes this is referred to as a hybrid schedule or hybrid work, but the federal government calls this telework. How often you are required to report to an office depends on the agency and the job duties.  

How to search for telework-eligible jobs:

1. Go to **More filters**.
2. Go to **Locations**.
3. Select the **Offers telework** checkbox.
