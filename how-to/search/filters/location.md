To search for a job by location:

1.	Enter a city, county, state, zip code or country in the **Location** search box at the top of any page. You may have to click on the **Search icon**, at the top of the page, to display the **Location** box.
2.	Keep typing the location or select from the auto-populated choices.
3.	Click **Search**.

Your location(s) will display above your search results.  

## Add and remove locations
You can search on multiple locations at the same time â€“ just enter another location in the **Location** search box (you can only enter one at a time). You can search by city, county, state, zip code or country. 

The locations will appear above your search results. To remove a location, click on the **x** next to the location you want to remove. Your search results will update every time you add or remove a location. 

## Change the distance within a location
When you search by a city, we automatically show you jobs within a 25-mile radius. Go to **More Filters** to change the radius. We do not use a radius if you search by state or country.

## Find jobs with relocation assistance
Some jobs offer relocation assistance. Go to **More Filters** and select the **Offers relocation assistance** checkbox.
