Some federal jobs are open to the general public &mdash; meaning any U.S. citizen can apply. But, some federal jobs are only open to eligible current or former federal civilian employees or people who may be eligible under a unique hiring path. You can filter your job search results to only show you jobs that meet your specific eligibility criteria.

### Open to the Public

If you select this option, you will only see jobs open to the public.

Select this option if you’ve never worked for the federal government and you are a:

* U.S. citizen or
* National or individual who owes allegiance to the U.S.

#### Who is a National or individual who owes allegiance to the U.S.?  

Most federal jobs require you to be a [U.S. citizen](../../../../working-in-government/us-citizens/), but there are some exceptions for [nationals and individuals who owe allegiance to the U.S.](https://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-9696.html), including those from the American Samoa and Swain Islands. The **Who May Apply** section of each job announcement lists whether the job is open to U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizens.
