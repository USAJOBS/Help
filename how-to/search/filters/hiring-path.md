Some federal jobs are open to the general public — meaning any U.S. citizen can apply. But, some federal jobs are only open to eligible current or former federal employees or people who may be eligible under a unique hiring path. You can filter your job search results to only show you jobs that meet your specific eligibility criteria. You can filter by one or more hiring paths.

You can filter your job search results by hiring path to only show jobs you may be eligible for. You must read the **This job is open to** section of the job announcement to determine if you’re eligible to apply.  You can also read the **Who May Apply** section, but not all job announcements have that information.

## Open to the public

This filter will only show you jobs that are open to the general public. 

Select this option if you're a:

* U.S. citizen or
* National or individual who owes allegiance to the U.S.

### Who is a National or individual who owes allegiance to the U.S.?  

Most federal jobs require you to be a [U.S. citizen](../../../../working-in-government/us-citizens/), but there are some exceptions for [nationals and individuals who owe allegiance to the U.S.](https://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-9696.html){:target="_blank"}, including those from the American Samoa and Swain Islands. The **Who May Apply** section of each job announcement lists whether the job is open to U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizens.

## Federal employees

There are a few options for both current and former federal employees.

### Competitive service
This filter will show jobs that are open to current or former competitive service employees. These are also known as merit promotion jobs. Select this filter if you’re a current or former competitive service employee who: 

* Holds or held a [non-temporary appointment](../../../../working-in-government/appointments/).
* Is in the [competitive service](../../../../working-in-government/service/) in the Executive branch or in a position not in the Executive branch specifically included in the competitive service by statute.
* Is in an [excepted service](../../../../working-in-government/service/) position covered by an [interchange agreement](../../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/federal-employees/interchange-agreements/).
* Is eligible for [reinstatement](../../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/federal-employees/reinstatement/).

As a current of former federal employee, you can also apply to jobs that are open to the public.

## Senior Executives
There are a couple of different options, if you’re looking for a senior executive level job in the Federal Government.
1. The Senior Executive Service (SES)
2. Senior executive level jobs outside of the SES

Jobs in the SES are executive level positions classified above General Schedule (GS) grade 15 or equivalent positions in most Executive Branch agencies of the Federal Government. To qualify for these jobs you must meet the five Executive Core Qualifications.

Not all senior executive level jobs are in the SES.  Agencies in the competitive or excepted service may have executive level jobs, where you may not have to meet the same qualification requirements as in the SES. [Learn more about senior executive jobs](../../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/senior-executive-service/).

Learn more about [which jobs you are eligible to apply for](../../../../faq/application/eligibility/).

## Additional paths

### Individuals with disabilities
If you’re an individual with a disability you can apply and compete for any job that you’re eligible for and meet the qualifications. However, some jobs offer the Schedule A hiring path. Schedule A gives federal agencies an optional, potentially faster, way to hire individuals with disabilities. Select this option to see jobs that offer the Schedule A hiring path.

[Learn more about the individuals with a disability hiring path](../../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/individuals-with-disabilities/).

### Family of overseas employees

If you’re currently overseas with a family member, and moving back to the United States, you may be eligible for a competitive service job without having to compete with the public. If you’re moving overseas, because a family member has been assigned to an overseas duty of station, you may be eligible to apply for overseas jobs with the Federal Government.

### Native Americans
Select this filter if you want to see jobs open to people with a tribal affiliation.
