Some federal jobs are open to the general public — meaning any U.S. citizen can apply. But, some federal jobs are only open to eligible current or former federal civilian employees or people who may be eligible under a unique hiring path. You can filter your job search results to only show you jobs that meet your specific eligibility criteria. You can filter by one or more hiring paths.

If you fall under one of the groups listed below, you may or may not be eligible for each job listed in your search results. You must read the **Who May Apply** section of the job announcement to determine if you’re eligible to apply.

## Open to the public

If you select this option, you will only see jobs open to the general public.

Select this option if you’ve never worked for the federal government and you're a:

* U.S. citizen or
* National or individual who owes allegiance to the U.S.

### Who is a National or individual who owes allegiance to the U.S.?  

Most federal jobs require you to be a [U.S. citizen](../../../../working-in-government/us-citizens/), but there are some exceptions for [nationals and individuals who owe allegiance to the U.S.](https://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-9696.html){:target="_blank"}, including those from the American Samoa and Swain Islands. The **Who May Apply** section of each job announcement lists whether the job is open to U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizens.

## Federal employees

Select this option to see jobs open to current or former federal employees. You may also see jobs open to current agency employees – an agency may post a job that is only open to current agency employees. You must read the **Who May Apply** section to find out if you’re eligible to apply.

Select this option if you're:

### A current or former federal civilian employee

* Who holds or held a [non-temporary appointment](../../../../working-in-government/appointments/).
