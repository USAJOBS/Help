You can filter your results by one or more of the following [work schedules](../../../../working-in-government/pay-and-leave/work-schedules/). 

## Full-time
A full-time job requires most employees to work 40 hours per work week.  There may be slight variations in this schedule.

## Part-time
A part-time job requires most employees to work less than 40 hours per work week.  The number of hours may vary depending on the job.

## Shift-work
Shift-work requires coverage 24 hours per day, and sometimes 7 days per week.  A shift-work job means you’ll work during a set period of time within that 24 hour period. You may work a night shift, morning shift or you may rotate shifts with other workers.  The exact schedule may vary depending on the job.

## Intermittent
An intermittent job requires you to work from time to time – there is no set schedule.  This is not the same as a part-time job.

## Job sharing
A job share job requires you to share a full-time job with another employee.  You and the other employee share the full-time job responsibilities and receive salary and benefits on a pro-rata basis. Each job sharer can work up to 32 hours per week. 

## Multiple
A job with multiple work schedules usually means there is more than one position that can be filled and the work schedules may vary.
