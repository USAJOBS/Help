## Types of security clearance
Not all federal jobs require a security clearance, but there is a range based on the type of access to sensitive and National Security information.  A higher security clearance level will require a more extensive background investigation.  Read the job announcement carefully to determine the level of clearance required.  During the application process you will receive instructions on how to provide security clearance information.
