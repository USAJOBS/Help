## What is searching by keyword?  

Searching by a suggested keyword gives you more specific search results than searching more broadly on USAJOBS. For example, instead of searching for "attorney", you can select "patent attorney" and search for announcements with that keyword.  

## How to search by keyword
Use the keyword search box to start entering a job title, department, agency, job series or other keywords. We will provide a list of keywords you can choose from. The keyword search box is located at the top of the page. You may have to click the search icon in the upper right corner to make the search box appear.

## Search for a single keyword

When you enter a single keyword, we’ll look for all jobs that contain the keyword.  We’ll display the most relevant jobs first. For example, if the keyword appears in the job title, we’ll display those jobs first.

## Search for multiple keywords

When you enter more than one keyword, we’ll look for jobs that contain all of the keywords together. Each of the keywords you enter must exist in the job announcement for that announcement to be returned. For example, if you enter "program analyst", we’ll look for jobs that contain both program and analyst together.
