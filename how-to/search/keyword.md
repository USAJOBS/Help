Use the keyword search box to enter a job title, department, agency, job series or other keywords. The keyword search box is located at the top of the page. You may have to click the search icon in the upper right corner to make the search box appear.

## Search for a single keyword
When you enter a single keyword, we’ll look for all jobs that contain the keyword.  We’ll display the most relevant jobs first. For example, if the keyword appears in the job title, we’ll display those jobs first. 

## Search for multiple keywords
When you enter more than one keyword, we’ll look for jobs that contain all of the keywords together, as well as jobs that contain any of the keywords.  We’ll display jobs that have all of the keywords first. For example, if you enter program analyst, we’ll look for jobs that contain both program and analyst together, as well as jobs that contain just program, or just analyst.

## Search for an exact match
You can use quotations to help you search for an exact match. For example, if you search for “physical fitness”, we’ll only show jobs that include the words “physical fitness” side-by-side.
