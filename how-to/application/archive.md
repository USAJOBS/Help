Your archive contains job applications that you want to save, but may not want to see in your active application list. Archiving can help keep your active job application list current and manageable. You can always unarchive if you want to reuse the job application.

## To archive a job application

1.	Sign into your USAJOBS profile.
2.	Go into your **Active** application listing.
3.	Find the application you want to archive and click the **+** to expand the content.
4.	Select the **Archive** icon at the bottom of the application listing. This will move the application from your active list to your archive list.

## To unarchive a job application

3.	Find the application you want to unarchive and click the **+** to expand the content.
4.	Select the **Unarchive** button. This will move the application from your archive list to your active list.
