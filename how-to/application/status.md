## What does each application status mean?

Each status tells you where the job is in the hiring process—whether a hiring agency is accepting applications, referring applications, hiring complete, or canceled.

**Accepting Applications**

This job announcement is open and accepting applications. You can apply now.

**Reviewing Applications**

The job announcement is closed, and the hiring agency is reviewing applications.

**Hiring Complete**

Hiring is completed and the position is filled.

**Job Canceled**

The job announcement has been withdrawn without anyone being hired. A job announcement can be canceled any time after the job is posted.

## Are there status delays for faxed documents?

Yes. If you [fax a resume or any other documents](../../account/documents/fax/), there may be a delay between when the documents are faxed and when they appear as received on an application. If you have questions about the status of your faxed documents, [contact the hiring agency](../agency/contact/).

## How long can you keep your applications?

We will permanently remove all applications (active and archived) 36 months after the closing date, regardless of the application status. You can print the announcements or export application information to excel if you wish to keep a record of them beyond the 36-month period.

## How to find and filter applications  

You can find and filter your active and archived job applications by status—this is the status the hiring agency reports to USAJOBS.

### Filtering

1.	Choose either your **Active** or **Archived** application list.
2.	Click **Find &amp; filter applications**.
3.	Select at least one of the status checkboxes. You can select more than one status at a time.
4.	Review your applications list—the applications will automatically filter based on your selection.

* The number next to each status tells you how many of your applications have that status.
* A brief description of each status appears if you place your cursor on top of the status (For example, place your cursor on top of Received to reveal the description).

### Finding

1.	Choose either your **Active** or **Archived** application list.
2.	Click **Find &amp; filter applications**.
3.	Enter a job title, agency or job announcement number into the search field and click the search icon or press return.
4.	Review your applications list.

## Have questions about the job status?

The hiring agency sends the status to USAJOBS. USAJOBS does not have any control over the status or lack of a status. You can access updates from the agency by using the **Track Your Application** link in your USAJOBS profile or [contact the staffing point of contact on the job announcement](../agency/contact/).
