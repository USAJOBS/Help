## Additional information

* Job announcements that are open are still accepting new applications and edited applications.
* Job announcements that are closed are no longer accepting applications or edits to previously submitted applications.
* If you want to edit your application with a newer version of your resume or documents or new profile information, you must resubmit the application with the changes—simply updating the information in your USAJOBS account does not submit the changes.
* If you resubmit your application with a newer resume or document, your application may continue to display both old and new information. The agency will review your most recent submission and provide a date/time stamp next to each attachment. Agencies have certain legal requirements for records retention; however, you may request that the agency remove you from consideration or accept changes or additions to your application by contacting the agency representative listed on the job announcement.
