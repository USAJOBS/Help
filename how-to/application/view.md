When you sign in to your USAJOBS profile, you’ll see a list of your job applications.  Any job application you create on USAJOBS is automatically saved to your profile &mdash; this includes complete, incomplete and archived applications.

## Active vs. archived applications
Job applications are grouped into active and archived. Active applications are applications you’re currently working on or waiting to hear back on. Archived applications are applications you want to keep, but may not want to see if your active list.

You’ll only see the ten most recent applications, but you can choose to display more.

## What’s in the job application listing?

Each job application listing gives a quick summary of the position, the status of your application, and if you need to finish or edit the application. Here’s what you can do:

### Sort your applications
Your applications are listed from newest to oldest by default, but you can sort by:

* Last updated
* Agency
* Job title
* Closing date
* Job Status

### Receive email notifications
You can receive emails to remind you if a job you have saved or started an application for will close in three days or if a job you saved or applied to is closed. To get email notifications, click on the Notifications icon and select which email(s) you want to receive.


### View job announcement information

Click the **+** to see more details about the job application. Each application has a summary including:

* Position title
* Hiring agency
* Job location(s)
* Closing date
* Last updated date
*	[Work schedule](../../../working-in-government/pay-and-leave/work-schedules/)
*	[Series and grade](../../../faq/pay/series-and-grade/)
*	[Salary range](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/){:target="_blank"}

[Learn more about the job announcement](../../job-announcement/).

### View the job or application status

Each job is labeled with a status to indicate its progress through the federal application process. These statuses will tell you if the job announcement is accepting applications, reviewing applications, canceled, or if hiring is complete. [Understand the different application statuses](../status/).

You will also see the dates you have applied or updated your application for each job announcement.

### Finish or Update your application

Depending on the status of your job application, and if the job is still accepting applications, you may see a button to **Finish My Application** or **Edit My Application**.

You may need to [continue an application](../continue/), if it’s still in progress and you haven’t submitted it yet.

You may need to [update an application](../update/) if it was rejected as incomplete or if the job is still open and you want to add more information.

### Archive

You can archive a job application to save it for your personal records and get it out of your active list. [Learn how to archive an application](../archive).
