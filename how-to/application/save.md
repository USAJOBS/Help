We automatically save your application during the USAJOBS application process. Every time you click **Save & Continue**, your application is saved for that step in the process. 

However, once you enter the specific agency application system, your application may not be automatically savedâ€”make sure you periodically save your work. 

You can view your saved application in your USAJOBS profile:

1.	Sign into your USAJOBS profile.
2.	Go to your **Applications**. 
3.	Select **Active** or **Archived** to view your active and archived applications.
