The **Requirements** section describes the type of experience you need, certain conditions you need to agree to for the job and how the hiring agency will evaluate your application.

## Conditions of Employment

This section lists 'conditions' that you must agree to, or qualify for, if you get hired and accept the job. The conditions may vary from job to job. A few examples include:
* Type of citizenship
* Specific resume instructions
* The need for a background investigation


## Qualifications

The **Qualifications** section describes the experience, skills and other job related criteria. You must meet these qualifications to be considered for the job. Itâ€™s important that you read the entire section; some job announcements include multiple qualifications.
