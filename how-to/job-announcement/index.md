Federal agencies post job announcements on USAJOBS to advertise their current job openings. While these job announcements can be lengthy, they include valuable information about the job and it's important you read each section before applying. 

The job announcement includes the following sections:

* [Overview](overview/)
* [Duties](duties/)
* [Requirements](requirements/)
* [How you'll be evaluated](evaluated/)
* [Required documents](required-documents/)
* [How to apply](how-to-apply/)

## Start your application

Once you read the entire announcement and are ready to apply, select the **Apply** button to begin the application process. If youâ€™re not ready to apply, select the **Save** link to add the job announcement to your **Saved Jobs** in your USAJOBS account.

## Share and print the job announcement

* Select the **Share** link to send or promote job announcements via email or social media.
* Select the **Print** link to open a printer friendly version of the job announcement in a new tab.
