Job announcements can close in one of three ways:

## Closing date

Most job announcements close on the indicated closing date.

## Open continuous

Some job announcements stay open indefinitely. They will usually indicate a date at which a pool of applicants will be selected for consideration.

## Applicant cut-off

Some job announcements close when a certain number of applications have been received. If that number is reach during the day the application will usually close that night at midnight.

For example, a job may indicate that it will close after 200 applications have been received. If 200 applications are reach at 1:30pm EDT the job would close at midnight of that day in the Eastern time zone.
