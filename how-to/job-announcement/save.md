You need to have a USAJOBS account and be signed in to save a job. You can save up to 25 job announcements in your account.

To save a job:

1.	Sign into your USAJOBS account.
2.	Search for a job by typing a keyword or location into the search box or run a saved search if you have one.
3.	Review the job search results.
4.	Click **Save Job** or the star icon next to the job title for each job you want to save. The link will change to **Saved** and the star will be filled in. This means the job is saved.
5.	Review your saved jobs in the **Saved Jobs** section of your account.

You can also save a job when you're viewing a job announcement -- look for the same yellow star and click **Save**.

## Manage your saved jobs in your account

The **Saved Jobs** section of your account displays each job you save on USAJOBS. You must sign into your account to see all of your saved jobs. Hereâ€™s what you can do:

### Sort your saved jobs

By default, the most recent saved jobs are listed at the top, but you can **Sort by**:

* Saved date
* Agency
* Closing date
* Job title

### Receive email notifications

You can sign up to receive an email any time a saved job is scheduled to close in three calendar days. To receive email notifications, click on the **Notifications** icon and select the checkbox.

### View job announcement information

Click the **+** to see more details about the saved job. Each saved job shows a summary including:

* Position title
* Hiring agency
* Job location(s)
* Closing date
* The date you saved the job
* Work schedule
* Series and grade
* Salary range

[Learn more about the job announcement](../).

### Apply, view more or remove saved jobs

Within the saved jobs details you can also apply, [remove](../remove/), or view more similar jobs.

### What if I don't see a saved job in my account?

There are a few reasons why you may not see a saved job in your account:

* The agency may have closed the job announcement-an agency may choose to close a job before its [posted closing date](../).
* The agency may have canceled the job announcement.
* You may have applied to the job. When you apply to a saved job it moves into your **Active** applications.
