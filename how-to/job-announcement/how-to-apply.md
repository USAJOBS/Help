The **How to Apply** section explains:

* The application steps, including a link to the **Application or Job Questionnaire**, if it’s required. 
* Other ways to apply for the job if you can't apply online.
* What happens next, after you apply.

## What is the application or job questionnaire?

Some jobs require you to answer several questions as part of the application process. You will see a link to preview the job assessment questions—read these questions before you apply to the job. Your resume must support your answers to the job questionnaire.
