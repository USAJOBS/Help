This section lists the work location(s). Many jobs have multiple locations.  Itâ€™s important you verify the location is somewhere you want to work.

## Number of vacancies per location
Some jobs have more than one vacancy per location.  The number of vacancies is listed under each location.

## Remote jobs

Under the **Location** header in the **Overview** section of the job announcement, we will list the remote job location as **Anywhere in the U.S. (remote job)**. 

In your search results, the location information, including whether a job is remote or not, is listed under agency name.
