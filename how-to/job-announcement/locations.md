This section lists the work location(s). Many jobs have multiple locations.  It’s important you verify the location is somewhere you want to work.

## Number of vacancies per location
Some jobs have more than one vacancy per location.  The number of vacancies is listed under each location.

## Relocation expenses reimbursed
This tells you if the job will pay for you to relocate. Each agency has different rules for reimbursing, so it’s important to ask the hiring agency which expenses are covered.

## Telework eligible
This tells you if the job has an option for telework.  Many federal jobs offer the chance to work from home. The work schedule and telework frequency depend on the agency and the job duties. Even if you see a “yes”, this does not guarantee you will have the option to work from home.
