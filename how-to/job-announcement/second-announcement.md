Sometimes there are two job announcements for the same job. Usually, one job announcement will be [open to the public](../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/public) and the other job announcement will be open to a set of other [hiring paths](../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/). The [**This job is open to**](../this-job-is-open-to/) section will tell you who is eligible to apply. Make sure you apply to the right job announcement.
