Jobs are sometimes posted to two announcements. Usually one announcement will be open to the public and another announcement will be open to a set of other [hiring paths](../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/). You must apply to the appropriate announcement so look carefully at the [**This job is open to...*](../this-job-is-open-to/) section.
