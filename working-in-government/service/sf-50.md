If you don't know which service you're in or your appointment type you can refer to your SF-50 (Notification of Personnel Action).

## How to find your SF-50

Each agency has a unique URL for they system that manages their personnel documents. Many agencies use OPM's eOPF tool. For example, OPM's eOPF can be found at <a href="https://eopf.opm.gov/opm/">https://eopf.opm.gov/opm/</a> whereas the Social Security Administration's eOPF can be found at <a href="https://eopf.opm.gov/ssa/">https://eopf.opm.gov/ssa/</a>.

Other agencies and departments host their own version of the eOPF tool. Thus you'll need to contact the Human Resources (HR) department at your agency to determine how to view your SF-50.

Note that the eOPF tool is often hosted on an internal network and thus only accessible from your agency's internal network.

## How to read your SF-50

### Determining service

#### Tenure - Block 24

On your SF-50 look for Block 24 named "Tenure".

* A **0** indicates that you may be in the [Senior Executive Service](../../service#senior-executive-service) or appointed by the President subject to Senate confirmation. You may also be in a group that is not defined in [The Guide to Data Standards](http://www.opm.gov/feddata/guidance.asp).
* A **1** indicates that you are a [permanent, career employee](../../appointments#career-appointment) and have completed three years of service.
* A **2** indicates that you are a [career-conditional employee](../../appointments#career-conditional-appointment). You are serving in a permanent position but you have not yet completed three years of service and may be serving an initial probation period.
* A **3** indicates that you are on a [temporary, term, or time-limited appointment](../../appointments#temporary-appointments).
* An asterisk indicates that you were appointed via a specific hiring authority that deviates from the above.

#### Position occupied - Block 34

Now look in block 34 named "Position occupied". The values here will be 1, 2, 3, 4 or asterisk.

* **1-Competitive Service** = [Competitive service](../../service#competitive-service).
* **2-Excepted Service** = [Excepted service](../../service#excepted-service).

Based on these numbers in block 24 and 34 you can determine your service and appointment type as follows:

* Tenure: 1 or 2 and Position occupied: 1-Competitive Service = [Competitive service](../../service#competitive-service).
* Tenure: 1, 2, or 3 and Position occupied: 2-Excepted Service = [Excepted service](../../service#excepted-service).
* Tenure: 0 = Most likely the [Senior Executive Service](../../service#senior-executive-service)

However, the Department of Defense and other agencies do have exceptions to these rules. For example:

* Tenure: 0 and Position occupied: 1 = Current temporary employee.
* Tenure: 3 and Position occupied: 1 = Current term employee.

If you see a combination of numbers you do not understand consult with the Human Resources department at your agency.
