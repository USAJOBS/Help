As a new or existing federal employee, you and your family may have access to a range of benefits. Your benefits depend on the type of position you have—whether you’re a permanent, part-time, temporary or an intermittent employee. You may be eligible for the following benefits. However, check with your agency to make sure you’re eligible under their policies.

## Health insurance

Most employees are eligible for the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHB). This program offers health insurance for you, your spouse and your children under the age of 26. It offers many different health plan choices, so you can find a plan that works best for you and your family.

## Dental and vision insurance

Most employees are also eligible for the Federal Employee Dental Vision Insurance Plan (FEDVIP). FEDVIP is a separate insurance plan from FEHB. You can sign up for dental plan, a vision plan or both types of insurance. You can choose from several different plans to cover yourself, your spouse and your unmarried, dependent children up to the age of 22.

## Life insurance

Most employees are eligible for the Federal Employees’ Group Life Insurance program (FEGLI). You can choose coverage starting at one year’s salary up to more than six times your salary, and you can get coverage on the lives of your spouse and eligible children too.

## Long-term care insurance

The Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program (FLTCIP) provides long-term care insurance to help pay for costs of care when you can no longer perform everyday tasks for yourself like eating, dressing and bathing, due to a chronic illness, injury, disability or aging. If you’re eligible for the Federal Health Benefits Program, then you’re also eligible to apply for FLTCIP. Certain medical conditions, or combinations of conditions, will prevent some people from being approved for coverage. You must apply to find out if you’re eligible to enroll.

## Flexible spending accounts

The Federal Flexible Spending Account Program (FSAFEDS) is a great way to help you save money by setting aside pre-tax dollars from your paycheck to help pay for eligible healthcare or child care costs. If you’re eligible as a new or current federal employee, then you can set up either a healthcare or dependent care flexible spending account or both.

## Public service loan forgiveness overhaul 

For a limited time, federal student loan borrowers may receive credit for past periods of repayment that would otherwise not qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (PSLF). This change ends October 31, 2022. After that, normal PSLF rules will apply.
