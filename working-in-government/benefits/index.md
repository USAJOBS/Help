As a new or existing federal employee, you and your family may have access to a range of benefits. Your benefits depend on the type of position you have - whether you're a permanent, part-time, temporary or an intermittent employee. You may be eligible for the following benefits, however, check with your agency to make sure you’re eligible under their policies.

## Health Insurance

Most employees are eligible for the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHB). This program offers health insurance for you, your spouse and your children under the age of 26. It offers many different health plan choices, so you can find a plan that works best for you and your family.

## Dental and Vision Insurance

Most employees are also eligible for the Federal Employee Dental Vision Insurance Plan (FEDVIP). FEDVIP is a separate insurance plan from the health insurance plan. You can choose to sign up for dental or vision or both types of insurance. You can choose from several different plans that can cover you, your spouse and your unmarried, dependent children through the age of 22.

## Life Insurance

Most employees are eligible for the Federal Employee Group Life Insurance plan. You can get coverage starting at one year's salary to more than six times your salary, and you can continue to get coverage into retirement if you meet certain requirements.

## Long Term Care Insurance

The Federal Long Term Care Insurance Plan (FLTCIP) helps cover you when you can no longer perform everyday tasks for yourself like eating, dressing and bathing, due to a chronic illness, injury, disability or aging.  If you’re eligible for the Federal Health Benefits Program, then you’re also eligible for FLTCIP.

## Flexible Spending Accounts

Flexible Spending Accounts are a great way to help you save money by setting aside pre-tax dollars, from your paycheck, to help pay for known and eligible healthcare or daycare costs. If you're eligible as a new or current federal employee, you can set up either a healthcare or dependent care flexible spending account or both. Retirees are not eligible for flexible spending accounts.
