The Federal Government employs permanent and temporary employees.

## Permanent appointments

### Career-conditional appointment

Permanent employees are generally hired under a career-conditional appointment. Normally this is the first career-type of appointment and the appointee must complete a one-year <span data-term="Probationary Period">probationary period</span> and a total of three years continuous creditable service to attain a career appointment.

### Career appointment

A person employed in the [competitive service](../service#competitive-service) on a permanent basis is appointed as a either a career or career-conditional employee.  Career tenure is attained after the individual successfully completes a probationary period and has three years of creditable service.

### Non-temporary appointment

A non-temporary appointment does not have a specific not-to-exceed date associated with it. In other words, it is not a temporary appointment.

### Non-competitive appointment

Under certain hiring authorities, which are established by law or Executive Order, a hiring manager may hire candidates directly without having to go through the full application process. Job announcements specify whether a position is competitive or non-competitive under the **This job is open to** section.

Veterans, persons with disabilities, many current and former federal employees and returning Peace Corps volunteers are examples of individuals eligible for non-competitive appointment.

## Temporary appointments

There are many types of temporary appointments, but the two most common are temporary and term appointments. These appointments are expected to last for a stated specified period with a not-to-exceed date.

* Temporary appointment: Time limited not to exceed one year but could be less.
* Term appointments: Time limited for at least one year but not to exceed four years.

Neither type of appointment is a permanent one, so they do **not** give the employee [competitive/permanent status](../service/).
