<h2 class="usajobs-help-center__lead">
  If you are a male born after December 31, 1959, you should be registered with the Selective Service unless you are exempt from registering. Those required to register usually do so between the ages of 18-26.
</h2>

USAJOBS does not collect this information, but you might be asked later in the application process or during onboarding if you are registered or to show that you're exempt.  

You can find this information by calling the Selective Service registration information line at 1-847-688-6888 or at [the Selective Service System website](https://www.sss.gov/verify/).
