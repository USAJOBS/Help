<h2 class="usajobs-help-center__lead">
  If you are a male applicant born after December 31, 1959, you must certify that you have registered with the Selective Service System, or are exempt from having to do so under the Selective Service Law.
</h2>

The Selective Service System is an independent agency within the Executive Branch of the U.S. Federal Government. It's mission is "&hellip;To furnish manpower to the Defense Department during a national emergency, to manage alternative service for men classified as conscientious objectors, and to register, with only a few exceptions, all male U.S. citizens and male immigrants residing in the United States who are ages 18 through 25&hellip;"

You can update your Selective Service status in [your USAJOBS profile](../../../how-to/account/profile/).

If you're hired, you will need to provide your selective service registration information during your on-boarding process. You can find this information by calling the Selective Service registration information line at 1-847-688-6888 or at [https://www.sss.gov/Registration/Check-a-Registration/Verification-Form](https://www.sss.gov/Registration/Check-a-Registration/Verification-Form).
