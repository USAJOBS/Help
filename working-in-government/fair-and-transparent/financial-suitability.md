<h2 class="usajobs-help-center__lead">
  It is the policy of the government not to deny employment simply because an individual has been unemployed or has had financial difficulties that have arisen through no fault of the individual. Information about an individual’s employment experience will be used only to determine the person’s qualifications and to assess his or her relative level of knowledge, skills, and abilities. Although an individual’s personal conduct may be relevant in any employment decision, including conduct during periods of unemployment or evidence of dishonesty in handling financial matters, financial difficulty that has arisen through no fault of the individual will generally not itself be the basis of an unfavorable suitability or fitness determination.

When making hiring decisions, we (the Federal Government) review your employment experience only to determine your qualifications and your level of knowledge, skills, and abilities. We don’t deny employment just because you’ve been unemployed or have had financial difficulties through no fault your own. However, if there’s evidence of poor personal conduct, during times of employment or unemployment, or dishonesty in handling financial matters, we most likely won’t hire you.
