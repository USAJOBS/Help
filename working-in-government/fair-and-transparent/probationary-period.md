<h2 class="usajobs-help-center__lead">
  If you're a new employee or supervisor in the Federal Government, you must complete a one-year probationary period.
</h2>

Your first year of federal employment is your "probationary period", during which your employer will decide if you're the right person for the job. If you're not the right person for the job, the employer can fire you at any point in the first year.
