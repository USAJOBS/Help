<strong>Partially true:</strong> Real people, Human Resource (HR) specialists, do look at resumes, however some agencies also use an automated system to review applications. For the agencies that do use an automated system, the resume review process has two parts:

1. An automated application review process to include all the required areas of the applicant’s eligibility and qualifications for the job. 
2. A manual review, by the HR Specialist, of an applicant’s resume to validate the information in the application package.
