<strong>Partially true:</strong> Real people, Human Resource (HR) specialists, do look at resumes, however some agencies also use an automated system to review resumes. The resume review process has two parts:

1. A manual review, by the HR Specialist, of an applicant’s resume to validate the information in the application package.
2. An automated application review process to include all the required areas of the applicant’s eligibility and qualifications for the job. 

The HR Specialist reviews the results of this automated process, as well as their own manual review.
