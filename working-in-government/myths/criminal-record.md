<bold>False</bold>. People with criminal records are eligible to compete for the vast majority of federal jobs. During the hiring process, Federal agencies are generally required to consider people with criminal records IF they are among the highest rated candidates and can comply with the job requirements. 
There are some exceptions, because specific laws or statutes prohibit employment, depending on the crime committed. For example:

* Certain federal laws, like those prohibiting treason, carry with them a lifelong ban on federal employment.
* Other federal laws prohibit federal employment for a certain number of years.
* The Bond Amendment imposes restrictions related to national security positions.
