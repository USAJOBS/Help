    <p>
      You’re eligible as long as you’re a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/working-in-government/us-citizens/">U.S. citizen or national</a>. Sometimes a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/working-in-government/non-citizens/">non-U.S. citizen</a> is eligible too.
    </p>
        <p>
      Even if you’re eligible under one of the other <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/">hiring paths</a>, you can still apply to jobs that are "open to the public".
    </p>
    <h4>Can I apply if I already work for the Federal Government?</h4>
    <p>
      Yes. Anyone, including current federal employees, can apply to these jobs. But, if you're a current federal employee and you apply to an "open to the public" job, you’ll have to compete against the general public. Your status as a federal employee does not guarantee you’ll get the job.

      In the job announcement look for the <strong>This job is open to</strong> section. When a job is <strong>open to the public</strong> you'll see the open to the public icon: <svg class="usajobs-icon--hiring-path usajobs-uhp-section__filters-uhp-icon {{ page.short-name }}" role="img"><title>Open to the public</title><use xlink:href="#{{ hp.icon }}"></use></svg> There may be other groups listed that can also apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      In search you can also select the <strong>Open to the public</strong> filter. Your results will display all jobs that are open to the public.
