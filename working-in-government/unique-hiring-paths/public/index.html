  </div>
  <div class="usajobs-uhp-section__col-right">
    <p>
      You’re eligible as long as you’re a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/working-in-government/us-citizens/">U.S. citizen or national</a>. Sometimes a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/working-in-government/non-citizens/">non-U.S. citizen</a> is eligible too.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, you can apply to these jobs if you’re a U.S. citizen or national and you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Have never worked for the Federal Government.</li>
      <li>Currently work for the Federal Government, but are in the excepted service.</li>
      <li>Currently work for the Federal Government, but you’re not eligible for merit promotion.</li>
      <li>Are not sure if you’re eligible for any other hiring path.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Even if you’re eligible under one of the other <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/">hiring paths</a>, you can still apply to jobs that are 'open to the public'.
