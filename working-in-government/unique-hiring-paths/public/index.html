  </div>
  <div class="usajobs-uhp-section__col-right">
    <p>
      You’re eligible as long as you’re a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/working-in-government/us-citizens/">U.S. citizen or national</a>. Sometimes a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/working-in-government/non-citizens/">non-U.S. citizen</a> is eligible too.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, you can apply to these jobs if you’ve never worked for the Federal Government, currently work for the federal government but don’t have status, don’t fall into any of the other hiring paths, or you’re not sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if you fall into one of the other hiring paths, such as a Veteran or a former federal employee, you can still apply to jobs that are "open to the public".

      Each job announcement includes a <strong>Who May Apply</strong> section. When a job is "open to the public" the Who May Apply section may say “U.S. Citizens” or “United States Citizens”.  There may be other groups listed that can also apply.
