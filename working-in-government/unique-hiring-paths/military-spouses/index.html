      Federal agencies can use the military spouse non-competitive hiring process to fill positions on either a temporary or permanent basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      You’re eligible if you are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Relocating with your spouse under Permanent Change of Station (PCS) orders.</li>
      <li>A spouse of a service member who is 100% disabled due to a service-connected injury.</li>
      <li>A spouse of a service member killed while on active duty.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are time limits on your eligibility.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You’re eligible for two years from the date on your spouse’s PCS orders.</li>
      <li>You’re permanently eligible from the date on your spouse’s documentation indicating his or her disability or death.</li>
      <li>You are no longer eligible if you remarry.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You must meet certain criteria for each of these eligibility categories. <a href="https://www.fedshirevets.gov/job/shams/" target="_blank">Learn more about the specific criteria for military spouses</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your eligibility does not entitle you to a job within the Federal Government. You must still apply and meet qualification standards and additional requirements, such as a background investigation.
