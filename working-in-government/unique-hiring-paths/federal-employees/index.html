    <p>
      Jobs that are open to current and former federal employees are called "merit promotion jobs". As a current or former federal employee it’s important to understand which <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/working-in-government/service/">service</a> you belong to, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/working-in-government/appointments/">the type of appointment</a> you are serving on and whether or not you have competitive status. Understanding these three things will determine if you qualify to apply for a position under merit promotion consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Federal Government consists of three types of services:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/working-in-government/service/#competitive-service">
          Competitive Service
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/working-in-government/service/#excepted-service">
          Excepted Service
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/working-in-government/service/#senior-executive-service">
          Senior Executive Service
        </a>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Within those services there are several <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/working-in-government/appointments/">types of appointment</a> including permanent and temporary limited appointments.
    </p>

      Eligibility

    <p>
      If you're a current or former federal employee within the competitive service, you are eligible for jobs that are open to current or former federal employees (also known as merit promotion jobs).
    </p>
    <h3>What does competitive status mean?</h3>
    <p>
      Having competitive status means you’ve worked for the Federal Government in the <strong>competitive service</strong>, and in a permanent appointment after completing a total of at least three years creditable service.  Sometimes this is also called having a 'career appointment' or being a 'status candidate'.
    </p>
    <h3>What if I'm a federal employee, but I'm not eligible for merit promotion or don't have status?</h3>
    <p>
      If you're a former or current employee, but you aren't eligible for merit promotion or don't have status, then you can apply to jobs that are <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/public/">open to the public</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Am I eligible if I have a temporary or term appointment?</h3>
    <p>
      No. If you're a current or former federal employee with a term or temporary appointment you can't apply to jobs that are open to federal employees, unless you previously worked in the competitive service under a permanent appointment. You can apply to jobs that are <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/public/">open to the public</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Does Veterans' Preference apply to merit promotion jobs?</h3>
    <p>
      No. Veterans' Preference does not apply to merit promotion jobs. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/veterans/">If you're a veteran, learn more about your hiring options</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>What about Transfers, ICTAP, CTAP, Reinstatement and Interchange Agreements?</h3>

      Merit Promotion
    </h2>
  </div>
  <div class="usajobs-uhp-section__col-right">
    <p>
      The merit promotion program allows a current or former federal employee apply for a job without having to compete with the general public. Instead, these individuals compete with other competitive status employees. The HR Specialist will rank applicants based on their experience, education, competencies and performance.
    </p>
    <h3>How do I know if it’s a merit promotion job?</h3>
    <p>
      On the search results page, select the <strong>Federal Employee</strong> filter. If a job is open to a Federal Employee, it is a merit promotion job.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also read the <strong>Who May Apply</strong> section of a job announcement. When it's a merit promotion job, the <strong>Who May Apply</strong> section of each job announcement will say "Status Candidates" or "Merit Promotion". There may be other groups listed that can also apply.
