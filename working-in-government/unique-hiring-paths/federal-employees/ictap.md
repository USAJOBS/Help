The Interagency Career Transition Assistance Plan(ICTAP) is an interagency program that helps "surplus" or "displaced" federal employees improve their chances of finding a new job at another agency (not their current or former agency), by giving them selection priority over other applicants from outside the agency.

You’re eligible for ICTAP if:

1. You're a current federal employee who meets the definition of a "surplus" or "displaced employee—you've received official notice that your job is no longer needed or that you will lose your job by Reduction-in-Force (RIF).
2. The agency you're applying to is accepting applications from outside of their workforce.
3. The job you're applying to is in the local commuting area.
4. You meet the qualifications and other requirements of the job you're applying for.

For example, if you work for the Department of Defense and receive a Reduction in Force (RIF) separation notice, you can apply for a competitive service job in the local commuting area at the Department of Education.
