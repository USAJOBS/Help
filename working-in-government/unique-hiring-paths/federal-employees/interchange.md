An interchange agreement gives current federal employees in the excepted service the option to apply to merit promotion jobs in the competitive service.

You're eligible to apply to a merit promotion job in the competitive service, if:

* You're a current federal employee in the excepted service (serving on a permanent appointment, not time-limited).
* Your agency has an interchange agreement with the agency where you want to apply.
