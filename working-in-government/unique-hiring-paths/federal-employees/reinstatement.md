Individuals, who previously held a career or career-conditional appointment with the federal government, may be eligible for reinstatement, which allows re-entry to the Federal competitive service workforce without competing with the public. Reinstatement eligibles can also apply for Federal jobs open only to status or merit promotion candidates.
