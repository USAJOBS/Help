A career or career-conditional employee of one agency may transfer, without a break in service of a single workday, to a competitive service position in another agency without competing or applying to a Job Opportunity Announcement open to the public. Individuals usually apply to agencies in response to job opportunity announcements for merit promotion or status eligible applicants.

An employee may transfer to a position at the same, higher, or lower <span data-term="Grade">grade</span> level. To transfer, the qualification and suitability requirements for the position must be met. Transfer eligibility does not guarantee a job offer.
