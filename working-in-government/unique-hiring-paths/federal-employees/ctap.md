The Career Transition Assistance Plan (CTAP) is an intra-agency program that helps "surplus" or "displaced" federal employees improve their chances of finding a new job in their agency, by giving them selection priority over other applicants, as long as they’re qualified for the job.

You're eligible for CTAP if:

1. You're a current federal employee who meets the definition of a "surplus" or "displaced employee—you've received official notice that your job is no longer needed or that you will lose your job by Reduction-in-Force (RIF).
2. Your agency is accepting applications from within or outside of the permanent workforce.
3. You meet the qualifications and other requirements of the job you’re applying for.

Each agency has a specific CTAP with more detailed information about the agency's transition policies. Please contact your Human Resources office for agency specific information.
