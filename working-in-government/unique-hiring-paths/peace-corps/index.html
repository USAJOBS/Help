      You’re eligible if you have at least two years of service with the Peace Corps or one year of service with AmeriCorps VISTA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your non-competitive eligibility lasts for one year after completing your Peace Corps or AmeriCorps service. Federal agencies may extend the period for up to three years if, after your completed service, you are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the military service.</li>
      <li>Studying at a recognized institution of higher learning.</li>
      <li>Involved in another activity, which in the agency’s view, warrants an extension.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Your non-competitive eligibility does not entitle you to a job within the federal government. You must still apply and meet qualification standards and additional requirements, such as a background investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When applying for a job, include your Peace Corps or AmeriCorps VISTA certification of service documents with your application and make sure to mention your non-competitive eligibility status on your resume. <a href="https://hru.gov/Studio_Recruitment/HT_05_VISTA-Peace_Corps.aspx" target="_blank">Learn more about hiring options for Peace Corps and AmeriCorps Vista alumni</a>.
