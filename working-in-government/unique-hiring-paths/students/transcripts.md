An official transcript is a copy of your permanent academic record and includes courses taken, dates of attendance, major, type of degree awarded, your cumulative grade point average (GPA) and all honors received at the school.

Start this process by contacting your school’s Registrar's Office. The Registrar’s Office will require specific personal information before fulfilling your request:

* Your handwritten signature
* Social security number or student ID number
* Current address and phone number
* Dates of attendance / graduation
* Full name / mailing address of recipients
