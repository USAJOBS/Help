You can also attach your DD-214 or SF 15 to any resume you distribute at a Pathways hiring event.

Learn [how to upload documents](../../../../../how-to/account/documents/upload/).

If you’re a veteran, visit [http://www.fedshirevets.gov](http://www.fedshirevets.gov){:target="_blank"}, email fedshirevets@opm.gov or call (202) 606-5090 for Federal hiring assistance.
