Yes. The Pathways Program is part of the excepted service, however it may lead to a permanent, competitive service job if you meet the program requirements and the needs of the hiring agency.

Your time in the Pathways Program may also convert to the competitive service.  So, if you worked through the Pathways Program for two years and then moved into a competitive service job, we count the two years towards your competitive service time.
