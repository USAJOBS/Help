Pathways Programs jobs are posted on USAJOBS. You can search for these job opportunities from the [Pathways Programs site](http://www.usajobs.gov/studentsandgrads). You can also use the search feature and select internships or recent graduates under the **Appointment type** filter.

Even though Pathways Program jobs are posted on USAJOBS, you may not be always able to apply online. If the **Apply** button is missing or disabled, review the **How to Apply** section of the job opportunity announcement - it will contain application instructions.

The annual [Presidential Management Fellows](http://www.pmf.gov) job opportunity announcement is typically available in the fall.
