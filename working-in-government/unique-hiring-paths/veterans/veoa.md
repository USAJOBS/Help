VEOA is a special hiring authority, which gives eligible Veterans access to positions that otherwise may have only been available to current competitive service employees. In VEOA appointments, preference eligibles and Veterans are not given preference, but they are allowed to compete for job opportunities that are not offered to other external candidates. A VEOA eligible who is selected will be given a career or career-conditional appointment.

## Eligibility

VEOA eligibility applies to the following categories of Veterans:

* Preference eligibles
* Service personnel separated after three or more years of continuous active service performed under honorable conditions.
