When a job is open to “all U.S. citizens”, it means anyone with U.S. citizenship, or who is a national (a resident of American Samoa and Swain Island), may apply. You can verify your citizenship with the [Self-Check through E-Verify (uscis.gov)](https://www.uscis.gov/mye-verify/self-check){:target="_blank"}, if available in your state of residence.

An agency may hire a qualified U.S. citizen into the [competitive service, excepted service, or Senior Executive service](../service/), if it is permitted to do so by the annual appropriations act and the immigration law and the agency’s specific laws and internal policies.
