Eligibility, in the federal hiring process, refers to being part of a particular group of people that an agency wants to hire – whether it’s a current federal employee, a veteran, or a recent graduate. There are several different eligibilities in the Federal Government; we call them “hiring paths”. For example, some jobs are only open to current or former federal employees—this means you must be a current or former federal employee to be eligible. Other jobs may be open to a current student or recent graduate—if you’re not a current student or recent graduate, you’re not eligible. Your eligibility has nothing to do with your work experience, skills, and other qualifications. Why is eligibility important? Understanding your eligibility will help you know which jobs you should apply to. You can apply to any job, but you may not be eligible for the job if you don’t fall into one of the required hiring paths listed on the job announcement. If you’re not eligible, the hiring agency will reject your application. What are qualifications? Qualifications include your work experience (years, type of work), skills, education level and your overall knowledge of a particular field of study. The hiring agency will look at your qualifications after they determine your eligibility. The hiring agency will rank you based on how well you meet the qualifications of the job. Regardless of your qualifications, if you’re not eligible, the hiring agency will reject your application and you will not be hired for that job. How do I know if I’m eligible for a job? Before you apply You must read the This job is open to and Who may apply sections of the job announcement to see if you’re eligible for the job. If you fall into one of the “hiring paths” listed, you’re eligible for the job. If you don’t fall into one of those groups, you should look at a different job. After you apply The agency will first review your application to see if you’re eligible. If you’re not eligible, they will reject your application—they won’t even look at your qualifications. It doesn’t matter if you have the qualifications – you must first be eligible. If you’re eligible, the agency will then look at your qualifications. How do I know if I’m qualified? Before you apply You must read the Qualifications section of the job announcement. Your application must show, you have the specialized experience, education, and other qualifications listed in the job announcement. After you apply If you’re eligible for the job, the agency will review your qualifications and rank you based on how well you meet the qualifications. The agency may rank you as “minimally qualified”, “highest qualified”, or somewhere in between.

If you have questions related to how much experience you need for a particular job, review the Job Requirements > Qualifications section of the job announcement. For additional questions, contact the hiring agency listed in the job opportunity announcement. The basics Like any employer, the Federal Government needs individuals to be well qualified for the jobs they hold. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) publishes qualification standards to help ensure federal employees can successfully and safely perform the work of the position. Whatever your background has been, it is likely that you are basically qualified for many different jobs, and highly qualified for some. When meeting the basic eligibility requirements, the agency evaluates and then ranks your work experience, accomplishments, education, training, and overall qualifications background against the qualification requirements of the position. You will receive a score or ranking based on how closely your background matches with the requirements of the position. Job applicants who receive the highest scores or rank in the top category are referred to the selecting official. Qualifying with higher education Some federal occupations require a college degree with a certain major field of study or completion of specific academic courses at the baccalaureate or graduate level. Such occupations tend to involve research, scientific or professional work (such as a specialist in contracts, medicine, engineering, biology, psychology, or accounting). To qualify, all college level courses must have been completed at a college or university that has obtained accreditation or pre-accreditation status from an accrediting body recognized by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education. The Human Resources staff at the agency advertising the job opportunity can advise you about your eligibility. There are many occupations where a baccalaureate degree in any field is acceptable. Job applicants usually enter such occupations at the entry grade levels (typically GS-05 or GS-07 grade levels [or equivalent]) and acquire on-the-job training and work experience before advancing to higher grade levels. Such occupations are sometimes advertised as “trainee,” “intern,” or “student program” positions. You may qualify for a GS-9 grade (or equivalent) level position on the basis of a master’s degree, and for the GS-11 grade (or equivalent) level on the basis of a doctoral degree. At these levels, however, the advanced degree must be directly related to the work of the job to be filled. Specialized experience, or experience closely related to the work to be performed in the job for which you are applying, can often be substituted for an educational requirement or qualify you for a higher grade. Generally, for jobs at the GS-7 grade (or equivalent) level and higher, your background must have included specialized experience. At least 1 year of the specialized experience must have been equivalent to the level of the next lower grade in the Federal service. This means, for example, to qualify for a GS-12 grade (or equivalent) level, you must have had a minimum of 1 year of specialized experience equivalent to a GS-11 grade (or equivalent) level. Qualifying for a non-degreed job If you have been in the job market for awhile and have accumulated an extensive work history, you may be well qualified for many positions even without a college degree. Except for certain professional and scientific positions, a college education may not be necessary. The nature of your work experience is what really counts. Job applicants can qualify for most federal occupations based on job-related work experience. If you are just starting out, you can qualify for jobs at the GS-2 level with just a high school diploma or as little as 3 months of general work experience for most clerical and assistant positions. “General experience” is a type of work experience that is not necessarily directly related to the position but demonstrates the ability to acquire the particular competencies/knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform the work of the position. At higher grade (or equivalent) levels, additional work experience is required. Starting at the GS-5 grade (or equivalent) level, positions generally require 1 year of specialized experience equal to the next lower grade. “Specialized experience” is a type of work experience that is directly related to the position which you are applying. This means, for example, to qualify for a GS-6 grade (or equivalent) level, you must have had a minimum of 1 year of specialized experience equivalent to a GS-5 grade (or equivalent) level. Qualifying for Trade, Craft, and Labor jobs Trade, Craft, and Labor jobs, sometimes referred to as “blue collar” jobs, have a separate qualification system from professional positions. Applicants for the apprenticeship programs for the various trades must demonstrate the potential to succeed in the job and the ability to complete classroom and on-the-job training. For journeyman or senior level jobs, applicants for trade jobs (for example, electronic equipment maintenance, electricians, plumbers, and carpenters) are rated against competencies/knowledge, skills, and abilities (commonly known as job elements) that are required for successful performance. Each trade has one or more critical job elements that applicants must meet to be rated basically eligible for the job. To be basically qualified, applicants must demonstrate mastery of the specified job elements through work experience, training, or tests.

Once you apply to a job, the hiring agency goes through many steps to review your application and make sure you’re eligible and qualified for the job. The amount of time it takes to hire someone varies and it depends on the job you’re applying to, how many people have applied and the hiring agency. The hiring agency is responsible for evaluating applications and giving you a status at four points in the application process: 1. Application received The hiring agency receives your application. However, the hiring agency will not look at your application until the job announcement closes. 2. Application reviewed The hiring agency has reviewed your application. This may take some time depending on how many people have applied and when the job closed. 3. Applicant referred or not referred The hiring agency decides to send, or not send, your application to the hiring manager. If you’re eligible and qualified for the job, the agency will pass your application to the hiring manager, who will then do their own review of the applications and schedule an interview if needed. It may take some time to schedule an interview depending on the number of referred applicants. And, there may be more than one round of interviews. 4. Applicant selected or not selected The hiring manager makes a decision to hire or not hire you. You can check the status of your application(s) in your profile. How long does it take once I get a federal job offer? If you receive and accept a tentative job offer, it may take a few weeks to a few months before you start the job. The background investigation and other security checks begin once you accept the offer. The length of these checks depends on the security clearance level of the job.

Eligibility for the Senior Executive Service (SES) Anyone is eligible to apply to an SES position (as long as you’re a U.S. citizen or national), but to be qualified, you must meet the five Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs). Executive Core Qualifications The ECQs help determine if you have the broad executive skills needed to succeed in a variety of SES positions. The ECQs are required for entry to the SES and are used by many departments and agencies in selection, performance management, and leadership development for executive positions. The five ECQs are: Leading Change Leading People Results Driven Business Acumen Building Coalitions Learn more about the executive core qualifications Applying for a job in the Senior Executive Service There are two ways you can apply for a Senior Executive Service position: Apply directly to a federal agency for a specific SES position. Apply for an SES Candidate Development Program (SESCDP). An SESCDP identifies and prepares aspiring senior executive leaders. If you graduate from this program and your ECQs are certified by an OPM-administered Qualifications Review Board (QRB) then you’re eligible for (but not guaranteed) career appointment to an SES position without further competition. Senior executive level jobs outside of the SES Not all senior executive level jobs are in the SES. Agencies in the competitive or excepted service may have executive level jobs, where you may not have to meet the same qualification requirements as in the SES.

Federal agencies can use the Schedule A Hiring Authority to hire an individual with a disability. Schedule A Hiring Authority Schedule A refers to a special hiring authority that gives Federal agencies an optional, and potentially quicker, way to hire individuals with disabilities. Applying under Schedule A offers an exception to the traditional competitive hiring process. You can apply for jobs using Schedule A, if you are a person with an intellectual disability, a severe physical disability, or a psychiatric disability. To be eligible for Schedule A, you must provide a \"proof of a disability\" letter stating that you have an intellectual disability, severe physical disability or psychiatric disability. You can get this letter from your doctor, a licensed medical professional, a licensed vocational rehabilitation specialist, or any federal, state, or local agency that issues or provides disability benefits. Applying using \"Schedule A\" can be a great way to get a Federal job, but it is only one of many options that may be available and you still have to compete with other eligible applicants. Federal agencies hire people using many options, so applying under \"Schedule A\" does not guarantee you a job. Tips for applying under Schedule A Mention your eligibility and that you want to be considered for \"Schedule A\" on your resume (and in your cover letter, if you use one). Select the \"Schedule A Disabled\" option in your USAJOBS account profile on the \"Special Hiring Options\" page – this helps your resume be searchable by agencies that want to find people who may be eligible to apply under \"Schedule A\".

The SPPC can guide you through the application process and answer questions. Most federal agencies, but not all, have an SPPC or equivalent role, such as a Special Emphasis Program Manager. If you are a person with a disability and interested in a job opportunity, contact the agency SPPC using the Selective Placement Program Coordinator directory . Learn more about the Selective Placement Coordinator . Accommodating individuals with a disability Federal agencies are required by law to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified applicants and employees with disabilities, unless doing so will result in undue hardship to the agency. The accommodations make it easier for an employee, with a disability, to successfully perform the duties of the position. For example, an agency may offer: Interpreters, readers, or other personal assistance Modified position duties Flexible work schedules or work sites Accessible technology or other workplace adaptive equipment You can request reasonable accommodations any time during the hiring process or at any time while on the job. Requests are considered on a case-by-case basis. To request a reasonable accommodation: Look at the job posting for instructions on requesting a reasonable accommodation. Work directly with the person arranging the interviews. Contact the agency SPPC. Request a reasonable accommodation verbally or in writing; no special language is needed.

Over the last 20 years, the website has evolved from a paper process into what is known today as USAJOBS.gov. Scroll down to explore Prior to 1996 Federal hiring was a paper process. Potential applicants would have to travel to federal buildings to view job announcements on bulletin boards or posted in “reading rooms”. 1996 Where it all began The USAJOBS website was launched. As the single entry point for federal employment, the initial site laid the groundwork for the evolution that would take place over the next 20 years. The original site was basic, featuring only current job openings, general information, and the ability to fill out an online application. 1996-2001 The Early Years USAJOBS evolves with the web. The website continued to enhance search, allowing users to identify jobs within a specific agency. Also, for the first time, USAJOBS provided users with a tool to create a resume that included their education, work experience, and other important details. 2002-2010 Rebranding USAJOBS began to expand even further and add more features. Job search and resume builder were improved, and the Information Center and Veteran Resource Center were added to provide additional help to the user. By 2008, the website began to take a more personalized approach by introducing “My USAJOBS” and was rebranded as a one-stop shop for job seekers. 2010-2011 The Facelift As part of the federal hiring reform initiative, USAJOBS underwent a major facelift. The redesigned site included a new basic landing page, an enhanced job search tool, and targeted resources for students, executives, and individuals with disabilities. 2011-2013 New and Improved USAJOBS continued to develop innovative changes. USAJOBS established a data vision and developed tools to support agencies in recruitment, sourcing candidates, and measuring effectiveness. This made USAJOBS more than a job board: it would now become a highly effective and strategic recruiting tool. 2014 Refocusing on user needs The USAJOBS team established six design pillars that serve as the foundation for all new designs: Design Pillar 1: Helping Hands Clearly guide applicants to the information they need to make confident job search and application decisions. Design Pillar 2: Keep It Simple Set clear application expectations and present a unified and simplified application process. Design Pillar 3: Where's Waldo Provide opportunities for applicants to showcase their unique qualities. Design Pillar 4: Speak my Language Convey information in a language that every applicant can understand. Design Pillar 5: One Stop Shop Serve as the most trusted resource for federal hiring information. Design Pillar 6: Looks Matter Provide a thoughtfully crafted experience that helps users accomplish their intended goals. 2015 Continued growth The USAJOBS program continued to grow into a robust team. The integration of the design and development teams allowed for more rapid iterations and research to better understand the needs of users. The team sought to not only improve user experience, but to also influence the end-to-end federal hiring process. 2016 Where we are today 11 million accounts 16 million resumes 1 billion searches per year 22 million applications started per year 14,000 + jobs available every day In 2016, USAJOBS has delivered a mobile-friendly responsive site replacing the app, a revised application process and a new user interface, Help Center, account experience, and landing page. “Our goal for USAJOBS is to provide relevant tools and resources to support job seekers in their quest for employment. In order to realize this vision, our team is leveraging data to its fullest potential to inform iterative design efforts that will result in connecting talented individuals to the right jobs.” — Michelle Earley USAJOBS Program Manager"},{"skip_index":true,"title":"Index","url":"/Help/index/","tags":[],"body":"215 pages A federal resume should not exceed two pages Location: /working-in-government/myths/resumes-should-not-exceed-two-pages/, Section: working-in-government, Category: myths About USAJOBS Location: /about/, Section: , Category: Appointment types Location: /working-in-government/pay-and-leave/appointment-types/, Section: working-in-government, Category: pay-and-leave Appointments Location: /working-in-government/appointments/, Section: working-in-government, Category: appointments Are Pathways Programs jobs paid?

The appointment type you are serving on. Understanding this will help you know which jobs you’re eligible for and prevent you from spending time on jobs for which you’re not eligible. Being eligible for a job is different from being qualified for a job. Understand the difference. Services Services are how the Federal Government describes categories of jobs that provide different options and benefits to the future employee. There are three services in the Federal Government. Competitive Service Positions with agencies that follow the U.S. Office of Personnel Management's hiring rules and pay scales. Eligible to apply for merit promotion jobs? YES Excepted Service Positions with agencies that have their own hiring rules, pay scales, and evaluation criteria. Eligible to apply for merit promotion jobs? NO, unless your agency has an Interchange Agreement. But you can apply to jobs that are open to the public and federal employees -- excepted service. Senior Executive Service Managerial, supervisory, and policy positions classified above General Schedule (GS) grade 15 or equivalent positions in most Executive Branch agencies. Eligible to apply for merit promotion jobs? NO, but you can apply to jobs that are open to the public or other jobs in the Senior Executive Service. Not sure what service you fall under?

Instead, you compete with other competitive service employees. How do I know if it's a merit promotion job? In the job announcement look for the This job is open to section. When it's a merit promotion job, you’ll see the Federal employee - Competitive service icon Federal employees competitive service There may be other groups listed that can also apply.

Veterans who are VEOA eligible may apply for these jobs, but Veterans' Preference does not apply to merit promotion jobs. If you're a veteran, learn more about your hiring options. Internal to an agency Some federal jobs are only available to current employees of a specific agency. Internal to an agency jobs can be in all three services.

Permanent appointments Career-conditional appointment Permanent employees are generally hired under a career-conditional appointment (Permanent - Career-conditional appointment). Normally this is the first career-type of appointment and the appointee must complete a 1-year probationary period and a total of 3 years continuous creditable service to attain a career appointment (Permanent - Career appointment). Career appointment A career appointment begins once an employee has completed three years of permanent substantially continuous creditable service in the competitive service. Non-temporary appointment A non-temporary appointment does not have a specific “not-to-exceed” date associated with it. In other words, it is not a temporary appointment. Non-competitive appointment Under certain hiring authorities, which are established by law or Executive Order, a hiring manager may hire candidates directly without having to go through the full application process. Job announcements specify whether a position is competitive or non-competitive under the “Who May Apply” section. Veterans, persons with disabilities, many current and former federal employees, and returning Peace Corps volunteers are examples of individuals eligible for non-competitive appointment. Temporary appointments There are many types of temporary appointments, but the two most common are temporary and term appointments. These appointments are expected to last for a stated specified period with a not-to-exceed date. Temporary appointment: Time limited not to exceed one year but could be less. Term appointments: Time limited for at least one year but not to exceed four years. Neither type of appointment is a permanent one, so they do not give the employee competitive/permanent status.

Competitive service Competitive service positions are positions subject to the civil service laws passed by Congress to ensure that applicants and employees receive fair and equal treatment in the hiring process. In the competitive service, individuals must go through a competitive hiring process (i.e., competitive examining) before being appointed which is open to all applicants. This process may consist of a written test, an evaluation of the individual’s education and experience, and/or an evaluation of other attributes necessary for successful performance in the position to be filled. Excepted service Excepted service positions are any federal or civil service positions which are not in the competitive service or the Senior Executive service. Excepted service agencies set their own qualification requirements and are not subject to the appointment, pay, and classification rules in title 5, United States Code. However, they are subject to veterans’ preference. There are a number of ways to be appointed into the excepted service such as appointed under an authority defined by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) as excepted (e.g., Veterans Recruitment Appointment) or being appointed to a position defined by OPM as excepted (e.g., Attorneys). More information can be found about excepted service in 5 U.S.C. 2103 and parts 213 and 302 of title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Senior Executive Service The Senior Executive Service (SES) is the corps of executives, selected for their leadership qualifications, and charged with leading the continuing transformation of government. These leaders possess well-honed executive skills and share a broad perspective of government and a public service commitment which is grounded in the Constitution. As the leaders of our federal civilian workforce, Senior Executives strive each day to create a more citizen centered, result oriented Federal Government. Special appointing authorities Special non-competitive appointing authorities are established by law or Executive Order. Agencies may use a variety of appointing authorities to hire job applicants. Examples of appointing authorities: Direct-Hire authority People with disabilities 30% Disabled Veterans appointing authority Veterans, individuals with disabilities, many current and former federal employees, and returning Peace Corps volunteers are all examples of individuals eligible for non-competitive appointment.

To complete this section, enter information and click ‘add work experience. See below for additional information on selected fields: Employee Information Please enter the company or agency name; your formal job title (e.g., Database Administrator); start and end date; and ending salary. Is this a Federal Civilian position? Federal experience includes positions you have held as a civilian employee paid by an agency of the Federal government. The pay plan, series, and grade fields refer to Executive Branch competitive positions and are not mandatory fields. If your experience does not fit, simply leave those fields blank. Active duty military members or experience working for a private contractor of the U.S. government do not qualify as Federal positions for this purpose. Duties, Accomplishments and Related Skills Describing your duties, accomplishments and related skills can be challenging. To help you do this more effectively, take a minute to review the suggestions included below. Focus On Your Goals Your resume should showcase the skills you possess, and how they relate to the field you want to enter and the job(s) you are seeking. Think about your career goals. Then narrow your scope to the positions that will further those goals. Once your career goals are clear, it will be easier to describe your skills in a meaningful way. Review Job Announcements Before you describe your own duties, accomplishments, and skills, try reviewing relevant job descriptions. Once you have an understanding of the competencies required for the jobs you are interested in, you can relate those requirements to your own experience. After reviewing the descriptions, list your matching skills, experience, training, and education. Use words and phrases used in the announcements. Incorporate other commonly used technical terms. Describe Your Experience When listing your past jobs, concentrate on experiences that are relevant to your career goals and the position you are applying to. For instance, if you had a summer clerical job and you are looking to apply for a professional position, you do not need to list that job. With the exception of your current position, omit any job that does not show how your skills and experiences relate to the type of position you are seeking. Think about the projects you worked on; what your specific duties were; what you needed to know to do the job; the tools, software, or equipment you used; what you accomplished. Include Achievements and Contributions Did your supervisor require that you list your accomplishments for performance reviews? If so, you can use those documents as a guide. If not, try listing your accomplishments from the last five years. Focus on challenges you met, problems you solved, results achieved, and any awards, promotions, and special benefits you received. It’s better to describe your accomplishments, than list your responsibilities. Writing Tips When writing about a work experience, keep your description concise, clear and organized. Use simple sentences that cite specific examples. Name any tool, software, or equipment you used, and any specialized knowledge you acquired. Instead of saying, ‘Performed the full range of project management duties for a new information system,’ use concrete examples: ‘Used Microsoft Project to develop timelines. Prepared budget requests; hired staff; selected vendors; negotiated contracts; designed and implemented a new UNIX client-server information system.’ Use action word phrases (e.g., designed and implemented new organizational structure plan; negotiated contracts up to 90K; delivered report on waste management). When you’re finished, ask yourself the following questions: Would someone who is not familiar with my occupational background understand the kind of work I do? Is there nonessential information (nice to have, but not helpful in meeting mandatory qualification requirements) in what I have written? Have I omitted any relevant experience or skills I possess that might distinguish me from other candidates if my resume reaches the desk of a selecting official? Have I adequately described major characteristics of my occupation or background and skills that are most common to my occupation?"},{"title":"Equal employment opportunity policy","url":"/Help/equal-employment-opportunity/","tags":[],"body":"To learn more, please visit the Office of Equal Opportunity."},{"title":"How to create a profile","url":"/Help/how-to/account/profile/","tags":["account","profile","create","support-profile"],"body":"You need to create and complete a profile to apply to jobs, save searches and save jobs.

With a login.gov account, you can sign into multiple government websites with the same email address and password. Why is USAJOBS using login.gov? login.gov uses two-factor authentication, and stronger passwords, that meet new National Institute of Standards of Technology requirements for secure validation and verification. By using login.gov, you’ll get an extra layer of security to help protect your USAJOBS profile against password compromises. What will happen to my USAJOBS profile? Nothing will happen to the information stored in your USAJOBS profile. You’ll keep all of your applications, saved searches and saved jobs.

You need to create a login.gov account, if you don’t already have one. Your old USAJOBS username and password won’t work anymore. You’ll need to: Create a login.gov account - you only need to do this once. Enter an email address during the account set up - use the same email address you use for USAJOBS (your primary or secondary email address). Create a new password.

Finish setting up your login.gov account. Once you’ve finished setting up your login.gov account, you’ll go back to USAJOBS to finish the process. Double check your USAJOBS Profile to make sure all of your information is accurate. You need to use your login.gov email address, password and the one-time security code every time you want to sign into USAJOBS. What if I already have a login.gov account? If you already have a login.gov account, you don’t need to create a second one. Use your existing login.gov email address and password, plus the one-time security code to sign into USAJOBS. What email address do I use to create a login.gov account? Use your primary or secondary USAJOBS email address, so we can automatically link your USAJOBS profile to your login.gov account. If you use a different email address, we won’t be able to automatically link your profile. We recommend you don’t use a .gov, .mil, .edu or any other ‘work’ email address. Instead, you should use a non-government and non-work email address. If you currently use one of these email types for USAJOBS, you may want to change it AFTER you get through the account set-up process. You also can’t use an email address you share with someone else. Why shouldn’t I use a .gov, .edu, .mil or other work-related email address? If you use a .gov, .edu, .mil or work-related email as your primary email address, and then you leave your government job, military position, private sector job or school, you won’t have access to that email address anymore. Without access to that email address, it will be much harder to verify who you are, if you need to reset your password. You also won’t get emails about jobs and other important USAJOBS information. Using a personal email address that you control (such as a Gmail account), is the best way to make sure you can always get to important USAJOBS messaging and profile information. What if I currently use a .gov, .mil, .edu or work-related email address for my USAJOBS primary email? If you currently use one of these email types for USAJOBS, you may want to change it AFTER you get through the login.gov account set-up process. Can I use a different email address from my USAJOBS email address, when setting up my login.gov account?

If you want to change your email address, we recommend you do it AFTER you’ve successfully linked your profile and login.gov account. Can I share a login.gov account with another person? No. Each person needs their own login.gov account. If you’ve shared your USAJOBS account in the past, with a spouse or child, you can no longer do this with login.gov.

What are the exceptions for non-U.S. citizens? In rare cases, a federal agency may: Hire a non-U.S. citizen into the excepted service or Senior Executive service, if the annual Appropriations Act, the Immigration Law and the agency’s internal policies allow it. Request approval to hire a non-U.S. citizen into the competitive service, if no qualified U.S. citizen is available. How do I know if a job is open to a non-U.S. citizen? Each job announcement lists “who may apply” and “qualifications” to help you understand if you fit the job’s requirements. The Who May Apply section will tell you whether or not a non-U.S. citizen is eligible for the job. If you still have questions after reviewing the job announcement, contact the agency listed on the job announcement or read the full legal requirements for hiring U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens. Legal requirements for hiring or not hiring a non-U.S. citizen There are several legal orders that decide whether a federal agency may hire a non-U.S. citizen: Executive Order 11935 requiring citizenship in the competitive civil service. The annual appropriations act ban on paying aliens from many countries. The immigration law ban on employing aliens unless they are lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise authorized to be employed. Executive Order 11935 on the competitive civil service Under Executive Order 11935, only United States citizens and nationals (residents of American Samoa and Swains Island) may compete for, and be appointed to, competitive service jobs. With Office of Personnel Management approval, agencies are permitted to hire non-citizens when there are no qualified citizens available. A non-citizen hired in the absence of qualified citizens may only be given an excepted appointment, and does not acquire competitive civil service status. He or she may not be promoted or reassigned to another position in the competitive service, except in situations where a qualified citizen is not available. The non-citizen may be hired only if permitted by the appropriations act and the immigration law. Excepted service and Senior Executive service Some Federal agencies (among them the United States Postal Service, the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Federal Bureau of Investigation), and some types of positions (for example, lawyers and chaplains) are exempt from competitive civil service hiring requirements. An agency may hire a qualified non-citizen in the excepted service or Senior Executive Service, if it is permitted to do so by the annual appropriations act and the immigration law and the agency’s specific laws and internal policies. Many agencies have executive level positions in the Senior Executive Service. Appropriations Act restrictions Congress prohibits the use of appropriated funds to employ non-citizens within the United States. Certain groups of non-citizens are not included in this ban, including: Persons who owe permanent allegiance to the United States (for example, natives of American Samoa and Swains Island). Persons lawfully admitted for permanent residence and seeking citizenship as outlined in 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3)(B). Persons admitted as refugees under 8 U.S.C. 1157 or granted asylum under 8 U.S.C. 1158 and have filed a declaration of intention to become lawful permanent residents and then citizens when eligible. Translators employed temporarily. People employed up to 60 days on an emergency basis in the field service. Non-resident aliens employed as wildland firefighters for not more than 120 days by the Department of the Interior or the U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, pursuant to an agreement with another country. Persons who were officers or employees of the U.S. Government on December 16, 2009. Also, some agencies are exempt from these restrictions. Although the above groups are not prohibited from being paid from agency appropriated funds, they are still subject to the requirements of Executive Order 11935 listed above and to the immigration law as summarized below. Immigration law requirements on employing citizens and aliens For any work to be performed in the United States, immigration law requires private and public employers to hire only individuals who are eligible to be employed. Those individuals are: A citizen (either by birth or naturalization) or national of the United States, An alien assigned by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS), Department of Homeland Security, to a class of immigrants authorized to be employed (aliens who are lawfully admitted for permanent residence by INS are the largest class of aliens in this category), or An individual alien who is expressly authorized by CIS to be employed. Please contact the local CIS office with questions about an individual’s citizenship, nationality, immigration status, or eligibility for employment under the immigration law. Although an alien may be authorized to work under the immigration laws, he or she is still subject to the requirements of Executive Order 11935 and appropriations act restrictions, as stated above."},{"title":"Why was my application not qualified?","url":"/Help/faq/application/not-considered/","tags":["qualifications"],"body":"The hiring agency determines whether or not a job seeker meets the minimum qualifications for a job.

There are several different eligibilities in the Federal Government; we call them “hiring paths”. Your eligibility has nothing to do with your work experience, skills, and other qualifications. You can apply to any federal job, but you may not be eligible for the job if you don’t fall into one of the required hiring paths listed on the job announcement. If you’re not eligible, the hiring agency will reject your application. Understand how eligibility is different from qualifications. Application process The federal application process is very structured—the hiring agency must follow a specific review process and vetting system. This process helps agencies hire the best qualified people, while being fair to all applicants. Your resume and qualifications Each job announcement lists the required qualifications for the job. Your resume must specifically describe how your knowledge, skills and experience meet these qualifications. Your resume is the only information the hiring agency will use to determine if you qualify for the job and the hiring agency will not make assumptions about what’s in your resume. Make sure you use similar words and phrases from the job announcement(s). The resume you use to apply to a federal job will likely require more information than the one you would use to apply to a private sector job—there’s a good chance your resume will exceed the commonly recommended two pages. Learn more about what to include in your resume. The review process Once you apply to a job, your application will go through a series of reviews. Here’s a summary: Review for eligible and minimally qualified candidates – the hiring agency will review all applications to see who is eligible AND minimally qualified and will pass those along to a second review. Review for best qualified candidates – the hiring agency will identify the best qualified applicants. This is not a ranking. There could be 1, 10 or more people who are ‘best qualified’ and these applicants will go to the hiring manager for a third review. Review by hiring manager to select hires – the hiring manager will review all best qualified applicants and decide who they want to interview. After interviews, the hiring manager will decide who they want to hire. Learn more about the federal application process. Merit System Principles The Merit System Principles are nine standards governing the hiring and management of federal employees in the executive branch. The principles help the government to: Be fair to all applicants and employees and provide open competition for employment. Protect employees from misuse of authority, political influence and other prohibited personnel practices. Steward the work performance of employees in the short and long-term. Learn more about the Merit System Principles. Appointment types An “appointment” is how the federal government fills their jobs. There are two main categories of appointments; permanent and temporary. Appointments do not affect the number of hours per week you work. Rather, they tell you if there’s a specific end date to the job. Permanent appointments have no specified end date. With a permanent appointment you can stay in the job until you decide to leave, retire, or are fired. A temporary appointment has a specific end date—these appointments have a ‘not to exceed date’ from one year or less to four years. Learn more about appointment types. Service types The Federal Government has three services: Competitive Excepted Senior Executive The hiring process and rules for each service is different. And, once you’re a federal employee, your service type affects your eligibility to apply to another job in another service. You can move from service to service, but there are different rules and requirements you must follow.

Review job announcement If you find a job you’re interested in, read the entire announcement to make sure you’re eligible and you meet the qualifications. For each job there are specific qualifications –your application must show how you meet the required qualifications. Read the This job is open to section to see if you’re eligible to apply. Read the Clarification from the agency, or the Who may apply sections for further eligibility details (not all job announcements will include this information). Read the Qualifications section to see if you meet the job’s qualifications. Understand the job announcement. Contact the agency representative if you have questions. The contact information is listed below the How to apply section of the job announcement. 4. Prepare your application in USAJOBS Read the How to Apply section of the job announcement before starting your application.

Before you submit, you may need to complete other agency-required steps such as: Providing more personal information. Providing more documentation. Answering eligibility questions. Completing an occupational questionnaire – look for a preview of the questions under the Required documents section. It may take you longer to apply to some jobs than others, because some agencies and jobs require more information than others. After you submit your application, go back to the Application section of your USAJOBS account and make sure the hiring agency received your application. Your application status will say Received if the application went through. You can always check the status of your application in your USAJOBS profile. How long will it take to receive an updated status? It may take a few hours, after you submit your application, for the agency to update your application status. You may also receive an email confirmation from the agency application system, but not all agencies send email confirmations. 7. Agency reviews application The hiring agency will start reviewing applications once the job announcement closes. The hiring agency will review your application to make sure you’re eligible and meet the job qualifications, and will place applicants into quality categories: Minimally qualified Highest qualified The hiring agency may update your application status to Reviewed, but not all agencies provide this status. After the hiring agency reviews all applications, they will send the highest qualified applicants to the hiring official—these applicants will see a Referred status in their application status. All other applicants (not being considered) will see a Not Referred status. 8. Interview The hiring official will review the “highest qualified” applications and select applicants to interview based on agency policy. The hiring agency will contact applicants directly to schedule interviews. Hiring officials can interview applicants using: A panel In-person Video Phone There may be more than one interview round. For example, an applicant may have a phone interview and then an in-person interview. How long will it take to schedule an interview? It may take some time to schedule interviews, depending on the number of people being interviewed. 9. Agency selects candidate After the agency completes all of the interviews, they will select a candidate(s) and contact them to start the job offer process. For those not selected, the hiring agency will update their application status to Not Selected. 10. Job offer The hiring agency will extend a tentative job offer. Once this offer is accepted the agency will start the background investigation. The agency may require additional security checks for jobs that need a higher-level clearance. When is the job offer final? The job offer is final when the agency successfully completes the background investigation and any additional security checks. The hiring agency will contact the candidate(s) directly to set up a start date."},{"title":"How does USAJOBS use my profile information?","url":"/Help/faq/search/profile/","tags":["search","profile","preferences"],"body":"Your USAJOBS profile provides us with important information about you, your background and your work preferences.

How to find your SF-50 Many agencies use OPM’s electronic Official Personnel Folder (eOPF) tool, which is an online system for managing personnel documents. Agencies that use eOPF have their own URL. For example, OPM’s eOPF can be found at https://eopf.opm.gov/opm/, whereas the Social Security Administration’s eOPF can be found at https://eopf.opm.gov/ssa/. The eOPF tool is often only accessible from your agency’s internal network. However, not all agencies use the eOPF tool. Ask your Human Resources department if you’re not sure where to find your SF-50. How to read your SF-50 Your appointment type Tenure - Block 24 On your SF-50, look for Block 24 named “Tenure”. You may see a 0, 1, 2, 3 or asterisk. A 0 indicates that you may be in the Senior Executive Service or appointed by the President subject to Senate confirmation. You may also be in a group that is not defined in The Guide to Data Standards. A 1 indicates that you’re a permanent, career employee and have completed three years of service. A 2 indicates that you’re a career-conditional employee. You’re in a permanent position, but you haven’t completed three years of service yet and may still be in your probation period. A 3 indicates that may be on a temporary or term appointment. An asterisk indicates that you were appointed through a specific hiring authority that deviates from the above. Ask your Human Resources department for more information if you’re unsure about what’s in your Tenure block. Your service type Position occupied - Block 34 Look at Block 34 named “Position occupied”. You may see a 1, 2, 3, 4 or asterisk. A 1-Competitive Service indicates you’re in the Competitive service. A 2-Excepted Service indicates you’re in the Excepted service. A 3-SES General indicates you’re in the Senior Executive service. A 4-SES Career Reserved indicates you’re in the Senior Executive service. If you have an asterisk or questions about Block 34, ask your Human Resources department to tell you the service type. Exceptions The Department of Defense and other agencies have exceptions to these rules. For example: If you have Tenure: 0 and Position occupied: 1, you’re a current temporary employee. If you have Tenure: 3 and Position occupied: 1, you’re a current term employee.

Advancing The job application has been received by the hiring agency and is being considered for employment. Received The hiring agency has received your job application. Reviewed The hiring agency has reviewed your job application, but has not yet determined if you’re qualified. Referred Your application is among the best qualified and is referred to the next step in the selection process. Selected The hiring agency has offered you a position. Hired You have accepted the position. Paused The job application has not been completed and requires further action. In Progress The application has been started, but not completed or submitted yet.

Hiring agencies use the job announcement to describe the job and the required qualifications, including: Level and amount of experience Education Training What to include in your resume Federal jobs often require that you have experience in a particular type of work for a certain period of time. You must show how your skills and experiences meet the qualifications and requirements listed in the job announcement to be considered for the job. Include dates, hours, level of experience and examples for each work experience For each work experience you list, make sure you include: Start and end dates (including the month and year). The number of hours you worked per week. The level and amount of experience–for instance, whether you served as a project manager or a team member helps to illustrate your level of experience. Examples of relevant experiences and accomplishments that prove you can perform the tasks at the level required for the job as stated in the job announcement.

These statements show in concrete terms what you accomplished. More resume writing tips Customize your resume You should tailor your resume to the job announcement rather than sending out the same resume for every job. Customizing your resume helps you match your competencies, knowledge, skills, abilities and experience to the requirements for each job. Emphasize your strengths and include everything you’ve done that relates to the job you’re seeking. Leave out experience that isn’t relevant. Use similar terms and address every required qualification Your experience needs to address every required qualification in the job announcement. Hiring agencies will look for specific terms in your resume to make sure you have the experience they’re seeking. For example, if the qualifications section says you need experience with “MS Project” you need to use the words ” MS Project” in your resume. Organize your resume to make it easy to understand You need to organize your resume to help agencies evaluate your experience. If you don’t provide the information required for the hiring agency to determine your qualifications, you might not be considered for the job. Use reverse chronological order to list your experience–start with your most recent experience first and work your way back. Provide greater detail for experience that is relevant to the job for which you are applying. Show all experiences and accomplishments under the job in which you earned it. This helps agencies determine the amount of experience you have with that particular skill. Use either bullet or paragraph format to describe your experiences and accomplishments. Use plain language– avoid using acronyms and terms that are not easily understood. Be concise Hiring agencies often receive dozens or even hundreds of resumes for certain positions. Hiring managers quickly skim through submissions and eliminate candidates who clearly are not qualified. Look at your resume and ask: Can a hiring manager see my main credentials within 10 to 15 seconds? Does critical information jump off the page? Do I effectively sell myself on the top quarter of the first page? Review your resume before you apply Check your resume for spelling and grammatical errors and have someone else, with a good eye for detail, review your resume. Important facts about the federal hiring process The Federal Government does have a standard job application. Your resume is your application. Hiring agencies use the job announcement to describe the job and list the required qualifications and responsibilities. After applying, the hiring agency uses the information in your resume to verify if you have the required qualifications stated in the job announcement. Once the hiring agency has determined who is qualified, they may use other assessments such as interviews or testing to determine the best qualified applications.

In the Federal Government, the work schedule is sometimes called a “daily tour of duty” and “weekly tour of duty”. Some work schedules have the same hours every day and the same days every week. Others may be flexible and change from week to week or day to day. For example, a work schedule could be Monday - Friday, from 9 am - 5 pm or Wednesday - Sunday, from 4 pm to midnight. The number of hours you work each day and the days of the week you work may vary depending on the job and the agency. Full-time A full-time job requires most employees to work 40 hours per work week, or 80 hours in a pay period. There may be slight variations in this schedule. Part-time A part-time job requires most employees to work less than 40 hours per work week, or less than 80 hours in a pay period. The number of hours may vary depending on the job.

You can add and store up to 50 separate work experience entries. If you want to add more, you’ll have to delete an existing entry. Your work experience For each work experience, include: Employer’s name Employer’s address Your job title Start and end date Your duties, skills and accomplishments You can also include (but aren’t required to include): Salary Currency of your salary Salary rate (is it bi-weekly, monthly, yearly, etc?) Average hours per week you worked Whether or not we can contact your supervisor What if I don’t want my current federal employer to see my resume? If you make your resume searchable, federal HR specialists and hiring managers can search and see your resume and profile. However, any work experience with an end date of “Present” will not be searchable or visible to these recruiters. How do I answer “Is this a Federal Civilian position”? Federal experience includes positions you’ve held as a civilian employee paid by a federal agency. Federal experience does NOT include any position as an active duty military member or a private contractor of the U.S. government. If you answer ‘yes’, you’ll see additional fields for the department and agency, series, pay scale, grade and appointment type. What do I include in the duties, accomplishments and skills section? Describing your duties, accomplishments and skills can be challenging. Here are a few tips: Focus on your goals Highlight the skills you possess, and how they relate to the field you want to enter and the job(s) you’re seeking. Think about your career goals. Then narrow your scope to the positions that will further those goals. Once your career goals are clear, it’ll be easier to describe your skills in a meaningful way. Review job announcements Review relevant job descriptions to get an understanding of the requirements for the jobs you’re interested in. Then, relate those requirements to your own experience—list your matching skills, experience, training, and education. Use words and phrases from the job announcement(s) and include other commonly used technical terms. Describe your experience Always include your current position, however only list past work experiences that show how your skills and duties relate to the type of job you’re seeking. Think about the projects you’ve worked on; what your specific duties were; what you needed to know to do the job; the tools, software, or equipment you used and what you accomplished. Include achievements and contributions Did you ever have to list your accomplishments for performance reviews? If so, you can use those documents as a guide. If not, try listing your accomplishments from the last five years. Focus on challenges you met, problems you solved, results achieved, and any awards, promotions, and special benefits you received. It’s better to describe your accomplishments, than list your responsibilities. Follow these writing tips Keep your description concise, clear and organized. Use simple sentences that cite specific examples. Name any tool, software, or equipment you used, and any specialized knowledge you acquired. Example Don’t say ‘Performed the full range of project management duties for a new information system,’ Do say (using concrete examples) ‘Used Microsoft Project to develop timelines. Prepared budget requests; hired staff; selected vendors; negotiated contracts; designed and implemented a new UNIX client-server information system.’ Use action word phrases, such as: Designed and implemented new organizational structure plan. Negotiated contracts up to 90K. Delivered report on waste management. When you’re finished, ask yourself the following questions: Would someone who’s not familiar with my occupational background understand the kind of work I do? Is there nonessential information (nice to have, but not helpful in meeting mandatory qualification requirements) in what I have written? Have I omitted any relevant experience or skills I possess that might distinguish me from other candidates if my resume reaches the desk of a selecting official? Have I adequately described major characteristics of my occupation or background and skills that are most common to my occupation?"},{"title":"How do I see search filters with 0 job openings?","url":"/Help/how-to/search/filters/zero-job-openings/","tags":["search","filters","future","openings","zero"],"body":"When you search for a job, we only show the filters that have available job openings.
