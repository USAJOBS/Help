Some of the things that should be included are your educational and work experience. This includes job titles, salary, employment dates, duties and accomplishments, and how it relates to the knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs) in the job announcement.</content>

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/working-in-government/pay-and-leave/appointment-types/">&lt;p&gt;The Federal Government offers various types of federal employment to suit the different needs of a diverse and dynamic workforce. Searching for the type of employment that is right for you is easy on USAJOBS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;multiple&quot;&gt;Multiple&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A job with multiple appointment types usually means there is more than one position that can be filled and the appointment types may vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;permanent&quot;&gt;Permanent&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Permanent appointments have no set time-limit. A job that is not a temporary or time-limited appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;temporary&quot;&gt;Temporary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temporary appointments have a set time-limit and include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detail&lt;/strong&gt; – A temporary assignment to another job. You must be a current federal employee to apply to detail jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intermittent&lt;/strong&gt; - Occurring at irregular intervals; not continuous or steady.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Term&lt;/strong&gt; – A job that may last one to four years. Term appointments may be used for project work, extraordinary workload, scheduled cancellation of a position, reorganization, uncertainty of future funding, or contracting out of the function.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temporary&lt;/strong&gt; – A job that will last no longer than one year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seasonal&lt;/strong&gt; – An annually recurring job that may last six months or more in one year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summer&lt;/strong&gt; – A job available during the summer months and is usually for students.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;student&quot;&gt;Student&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internship&lt;/strong&gt; – A job for current students (paid and unpaid) to learn about federal careers while remaining in school.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recent graduate&lt;/strong&gt; – A job for recent graduates seeking a career development program.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presidential Management Fellows&lt;/strong&gt; - This is a leadership development program accepting entry level advanced degree candidates in the Fall of each year.&lt;/li&gt;

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/working-in-government/appointments/">The Federal Government employs permanent and temporary employees.

## Permanent appointments

### Career-conditional appointment

Permanent employees are generally hired under a career-conditional appointment (Permanent - Career-conditional appointment). Normally this is the first career-type of appointment and the appointee must complete a 1-year &lt;span data-term=&quot;Probationary Period&quot;&gt;probationary period&lt;/span&gt; and a total of 3 years continuous creditable service to attain a career appointment (Permanent - Career appointment).

### Career appointment

A career appointment begins once an employee has completed three years of permanent substantially continuous creditable service in the [competitive service](../service#competitive-service).

### Non-temporary appointment

A non-temporary appointment does not have a specific “not-to-exceed” date associated with it. In other words, it is not a temporary appointment.

### Non-competitive appointment

Under certain hiring authorities, which are established by law or Executive Order, a hiring manager may hire candidates directly without having to go through the full application process. Job announcements specify whether a position is competitive or non-competitive under the “Who May Apply” section.

Veterans, persons with disabilities, many current and former federal employees, and returning Peace Corps volunteers are examples of individuals eligible for non-competitive appointment.

## Temporary appointments

There are many types of temporary appointments, but the two most common are temporary and term appointments. These appointments are expected to last for a stated specified period with a not-to-exceed date.

* Temporary appointment: Time limited not to exceed one year but could be less.
* Term appointments: Time limited for at least one year but not to exceed four years.

Neither type of appointment is a permanent one, so they do **not** give the employee [competitive/permanent status](../service/).

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/working-in-government/benefits/">As a new or existing federal employee, you and your family may have access to a range of benefits. Your benefits depend on the type of position you have - whether you're a permanent, part-time, temporary or an intermittent employee. You may be eligible for the following benefits, however, check with your agency to make sure you’re eligible under their policies.

## Health Insurance

Most employees are eligible for the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHB). This program offers health insurance for you, your spouse and your children under the age of 26. It offers many different health plan choices, so you can find a plan that works best for you and your family.

[Learn more about the health insurance plans](https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/healthcare/).

## Dental and Vision Insurance

Most employees are also eligible for the Federal Employee Dental Vision Insurance Plan (FEDVIP). FEDVIP is a separate insurance plan from FEHB. You can sign up for dental plan, a vision plan, or both types of insurance. You can choose from several different plans to cover yourself, your spouse, and your unmarried, dependent children up to the age of 22.

[Learn more about the dental and vision insurance plans](https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/dental-vision/).

## Life Insurance

Most employees are eligible for the Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance program (FEGLI). You can choose coverage starting at one year's salary up to more than six times your salary, and you can get coverage on the lives of your spouse and eligible children too.

[Learn more about the life insurance plans](https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/life-insurance/).

## Long Term Care Insurance

The Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program (FLTCIP) provides long term care insurance to help pay for costs of care  when you can no longer perform everyday tasks for yourself like eating, dressing and bathing, due to a chronic illness, injury, disability or aging.  If you’re eligible for the Federal Health Benefits Program, then you’re also eligible to apply for FLTCIP. Certain medical conditions, or combinations of conditions, will prevent some people from being approved for coverage. You must apply to find out if you’re eligible to enroll.

[Learn more about the long term care insurance plan](https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/long-term-care/).

## Flexible Spending Accounts

The Federal Flexible Spending Account Program (FSAFEDS) is a great way to help you save money by setting aside pre-tax dollars, from your paycheck, to help pay for eligible healthcare or daycare costs.  If you’re eligible as a new or current federal employee, then you can set up either a healthcare or dependent care flexible spending account or both.

    <id>/Help/faq/application/eligibility/ex-offender/</id>
    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/faq/application/eligibility/ex-offender/">Yes, you can work for the government if you are an ex-offender. Being an ex-offender does not prevent you from obtaining Federal Employment.

OPM or the hiring agency considers your criminal conduct in determining your suitability but there are no general prohibitions against hiring you. We consider a number of relevant factors such as the duties of the positions you have applied for, the nature and recency of the misconduct, and any evidence of rehabilitation.

Although there are no general prohibitions against employing you in the Federal Government, there are some regulations which will prohibit you from working in certain positions if you have a specific conviction. The most common situation involves being convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes under Federal or State law. These persons are “prohibited from employment in any position requiring the individual: to ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms or ammunition” (Public Law 1-4-208 Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997.)

Other statutory or regulatory debarments exist, but are rarely applicable. They cover debarment from Federal employment from such offenses as treason, inciting rebellion against the U.S., willful and unlawful destruction of public records, or knowingly and willfully advocating the overthrow of the U.S. Government.

It is important for you to provide all the required information about your criminal record when you apply for Federal employment. Then, either OPM or the employing agency can determine early if a specific prohibition exists.</content>

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/federal-employees/career-transition/">## Career Transition Assistance Plan (CTAP)

The Career Transition Assistance Plan (CTAP) is an intra-agency program that helps &quot;surplus&quot; or &quot;displaced&quot; federal employees improve their chances of finding a new job in their agency, by giving them selection priority over other applicants, as long as they’re qualified for the job.

You're eligible for CTAP if:

1. You're a current federal employee who meets the definition of a &quot;surplus&quot; or &quot;displaced employee—you've received official notice that your job is no longer needed or that you will lose your job by Reduction-in-Force (RIF).
2. Your agency is accepting applications from within or outside of the permanent workforce.
3. You meet the qualifications and other requirements of the job you’re applying for.

Each agency has a specific CTAP with more detailed information about the agency's transition policies. Please contact your Human Resources office for agency specific information.

[Learn more about CTAP (OPM)](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/workforce-restructuring/employee-guide-to-career-transition/ctap_guideline.pdf){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}

## Interagency Career Transition Assistance Plan (ICTAP)

The Interagency Career Transition Assistance Plan(ICTAP) is an interagency program that helps &quot;surplus&quot; or &quot;displaced&quot; federal employees improve their chances of finding a new job at another agency (not their current or former agency), by giving them selection priority over other applicants from outside the agency.

You’re eligible for ICTAP if:

1. You're a current federal employee who meets the definition of a &quot;surplus&quot; or &quot;displaced employee—you've received official notice that your job is no longer needed or that you will lose your job by Reduction-in-Force (RIF).
2. The agency you're applying to is accepting applications from outside of their workforce.
3. The job you're applying to is in the local commuting area.
4. You meet the qualifications and other requirements of the job you're applying for.

For example, if you work for the Department of Defense and receive a Reduction in Force (RIF) separation notice, you can apply for a competitive service job in the local commuting area at the Department of Education.</content>

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/working-in-government/us-citizens/">When a job is open to “all U.S. citizens”, it means anyone with U.S. citizenship, or who is a national (a resident of American Samoa and Swain Island), may apply. You can verify your citizenship with the [Self-Check through E-Verify (uscis.gov)](https://www.uscis.gov/mye-verify/self-check){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}, if available in your state of residence.

An agency may hire a qualified U.S. citizen into the [competitive service, excepted service, or Senior Executive service](../service/), if it is permitted to do so by the annual appropriations act and the immigration law and the agency’s specific laws and internal policies.</content>

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/working-in-government/non-citizens/">In general, you must be a U.S. citizen or national (residents of American Samoa and Swains Island) to work for the Federal Government, but there are some exceptions. 

## What are the exceptions for non-U.S. citizens?
In rare cases, a federal agency may:
* Hire a non-U.S. citizen into the [excepted service](../service/) or [Senior Executive service](../service/), if the annual Appropriations Act, the Immigration Law and the agency’s internal policies allow it.
* Request approval to hire a non-U.S. citizen into the [competitive service](../service/), if no qualified U.S. citizen is available. 

## How do I know if a job is open to a non-U.S. citizen?
Each job announcement lists “who may apply” and “qualifications” to help you understand if you fit the job’s requirements. The **Who May Apply** section will tell you whether or not a non-U.S. citizen is eligible for the job.

If you still have questions after reviewing the job announcement, contact the agency listed on the job announcement or read the full [legal requirements for hiring U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens](#legal-requirements-for-hiring-or-not-hiring-a-non-us-citizen).

## Legal requirements for hiring or not hiring a non-U.S. citizen
There are several legal orders that decide whether a federal agency may hire a non-U.S. citizen: 
* Executive Order 11935 requiring citizenship in the competitive civil service.
* The annual appropriations act ban on paying aliens from many countries.
* The immigration law ban on employing aliens unless they are lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise authorized to be employed.

## Executive Order 11935 on the competitive civil service
Under Executive Order 11935, only United States citizens and nationals (residents of American Samoa and Swains Island) may compete for, and be appointed to, competitive service jobs. With Office of Personnel Management approval, agencies are permitted to hire non-citizens when there are no qualified citizens available. A non-citizen hired in the absence of qualified citizens may only be given an excepted appointment, and does not acquire competitive civil service status. He or she may not be promoted or reassigned to another position in the competitive service, except in situations where a qualified citizen is not available. The non-citizen may be hired only if permitted by the appropriations act and the immigration law.


## Excepted service and Senior Executive service
Some Federal agencies (among them the United States Postal Service, the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Federal Bureau of Investigation), and some types of positions (for example, lawyers and chaplains) are exempt from competitive civil service hiring requirements. An agency may hire a qualified non-citizen in the excepted service or Senior Executive Service, if it is permitted to do so by the annual appropriations act and the immigration law and the agency’s specific laws and internal policies.
Many agencies have executive level positions in the Senior Executive Service.

## Appropriations Act restrictions
Congress prohibits the use of appropriated funds to employ non-citizens within the United States. Certain groups of non-citizens are not included in this ban, including:
* Persons who owe permanent allegiance to the United States (for example, natives of American Samoa and Swains Island).
* Persons lawfully admitted for permanent residence and seeking citizenship as outlined in 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3)(B).
* Persons admitted as refugees under 8 U.S.C. 1157 or granted asylum under 8 U.S.C. 1158 and have filed a declaration of intention to become lawful permanent residents and then citizens when eligible.
* Translators employed temporarily.
* People employed up to 60 days on an emergency basis in the field service.
* Non-resident aliens employed as wildland firefighters for not more than 120 days by the Department of the Interior or the U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, pursuant to an agreement with another country.
* Persons who were officers or employees of the U.S. Government on December 16, 2009.

Also, some agencies are exempt from these restrictions.

Although the above groups are not prohibited from being paid from agency appropriated funds, they are still subject to the requirements of Executive Order 11935 listed above and to the immigration law as summarized below.

## Immigration law requirements on employing citizens and aliens
For any work to be performed in the United States, immigration law requires private and public employers to hire only individuals who are eligible to be employed. Those individuals are:
* A citizen (either by birth or naturalization) or national of the United States,
* An alien assigned by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS), Department of Homeland Security, to a class of immigrants authorized to be employed (aliens who are lawfully admitted for permanent residence by INS are the largest class of aliens in this category), or
* An individual alien who is expressly authorized by CIS to be employed. 

Please contact the local CIS office with questions about an individual’s citizenship, nationality, immigration status, or eligibility for employment under the immigration law.

Although an alien may be authorized to work under the immigration laws, he or she is still subject to the requirements of Executive Order 11935 and appropriations act restrictions, as stated above.</content>

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/working-in-government/service/">The Federal Government consists of three types of services, the competitive service, the excepted service, and the Senior Executive Service.

## Competitive service

Competitive service positions are positions subject to the civil service laws passed by Congress to ensure that applicants and employees receive fair and equal treatment in the hiring process.

In the competitive service, individuals must go through a competitive hiring process (i.e., competitive examining) before being appointed which is open to all applicants. This process may consist of a written test, an evaluation of the individual’s education and experience, and/or an evaluation of other attributes necessary for successful performance in the position to be filled.


## Excepted service

Excepted service positions are any federal or civil service positions which are not in the competitive service or the Senior Executive service. Excepted service agencies set their own qualification requirements and are not subject to the appointment, pay, and classification rules in title 5, United States Code. However, they are subject to [veterans' preference](../unique-hiring-paths/veterans/preference/).

There are a number of ways to be appointed into the excepted service such as appointed under an authority defined by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) as excepted (e.g., Veterans Recruitment Appointment) or being appointed to a position defined by OPM as excepted (e.g., Attorneys). More information can be found about excepted service in 5 U.S.C. 2103 and parts 213 and 302 of title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

## Senior Executive Service

The Senior Executive Service (SES) is the corps of executives, selected for their leadership qualifications, and charged with leading the continuing transformation of government. These leaders possess well-honed executive skills and share a broad perspective of government and a public service commitment which is grounded in the Constitution. As the leaders of our federal civilian workforce, Senior Executives strive each day to create a more citizen centered, result oriented Federal Government.

## Special appointing authorities

Special non-competitive appointing authorities are established by law or Executive Order. Agencies may use a variety of appointing authorities to hire job applicants. Examples of appointing authorities:

* [Direct-Hire authority](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/direct-hire-authority/){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}
* [People with disabilities](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/disability-employment/){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}
* [30% Disabled Veterans appointing authority](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/veterans-authorities/){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}

Veterans, individuals with disabilities, many current and former federal employees, and returning Peace Corps volunteers are all examples of individuals eligible for [non-competitive appointment](../appointments/).

  It is the policy of the government not to deny employment simply because an individual has been unemployed or has had financial difficulties that have arisen through no fault of the individual. Information about an individual’s employment experience will be used only to determine the person’s qualifications and to assess his or her relative level of knowledge, skills, and abilities. Although an individual’s personal conduct may be relevant in any employment decision, including conduct during periods of unemployment or evidence of dishonesty in handling financial matters, financial difficulty that has arisen through no fault of the individual will generally not itself be the basis of an unfavorable suitability or fitness determination.
&lt;/h2&gt;

When making hiring decisions, we (the Federal Government) review your employment experience only to determine your qualifications and your level of knowledge, skills, and abilities. We don’t deny employment just because you’ve been unemployed or have had financial difficulties through no fault your own. However, if there’s evidence of poor personal conduct, during times of employment or unemployment, or dishonesty in handling financial matters, we most likely won’t hire you.

30% or More Disabled Veteran allows any veteran with a 30% or more service-connected disability to be non-competitively appointed.

You are eligible if you:

* Retired from active military service with a service-connected disability rating of 30% or more; OR
* You have a rating by the Department of Veterans Affairs showing a compensable service-connected disability of 30% or more.

## Disabled Veterans Enrolled in a VA Training Program

Disabled veterans eligible for training under the VA vocational rehabilitation program may enroll for training or work experience at an agency under the terms of an agreement between the agency and VA.

## Schedule A Appointing Authority

Though not specifically for veterans, the [Schedule A authority for people with disabilities](../../individuals-with-disabilities/) is an excepted authority that agencies can use to appoint eligible veterans who have a severe physical, psychological, or intellectual disability.

We hide the filters with zero job openings to make it easier for you to review your results and options.  If you want to see all filters, including the ones with zero job openings, click **Show options with 0 jobs** under **Top Filters**. 

## Why do I want to see options with 0 jobs?
You may want to set up a saved search including filters with 0 jobs openings because there may be job openings in the future. You can set up a saved search and get an email notification when a new job is posted and matches what you’re looking for. 

For example, there are some jobs that are only available at certain times of the year, such as a Presidential Management Fellow.  If you want to find a Presidential Management Fellow (PMF) job, but there are none available yet, you can set up a saved search using that filter. If a new PMF job is posted, we’ll email you with a link to updated search results.

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/faq/search/profile/">Your USAJOBS profile provides us with important information about you, your background and your work preferences. You must complete the required sections of your profile if you want to apply to a job on USAJOBS, but there are benefits to completing all sections of your profile.

## Contact and Eligibility

We use your contact and eligibility information when you apply to a job – we auto-complete certain fields in the job application process with this information.

### Preferences

We use your preferences to:

1.	Improve your job search results. When you’re signed in, and start a job search, we’ll look for jobs that match your preferences, such as your desired work location, schedule, travel, and more.

2.	Help agencies match your work preferences with the job opportunities they’re looking to fill – we only use this if you’ve made your resume searchable.

### Demographics

We use your demographics information to find out if our recruitment efforts are reaching all segments of the population, consistent with federal equal employment opportunity laws. Completing the demographics section is optional. We don’t provide your demographics to anyone involved in reviewing your application or to the public and we don’t keep this information in your personnel file.</content>

    <id>/Help/faq/application/process/</id>
    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/faq/application/process/">This is a quick summary of how the federal application process works when you use USAJOBS to apply for positions.

## 1. Create an account with login.gov

First, you need to [create an account with login.gov](https://login.usajobs.gov/Access/Transition).  

## 2. Create a USAJOBS profile

Once you have a login.gov account, you need to [create a profile on USAJOBS](../../../how-to/account/profile/) to apply to any job.

With a USAJOBS profile you can:

* Apply to any job on USAJOBS.
* Save jobs you’re interested in.
* Save and automate job searches.
* Upload and save resumes or create one using our resume builder.
* Upload and save required documents.
* Have a more personalized experience.


## 3. Search for jobs

Start your job search by typing in a keyword or location. Use our search filters to narrow your results by salary, work schedule, agency and more.

You can search for jobs anytime, but it’s best to create and sign into your profile before doing a search. Why? Because, we can use your profile information to improve your job search results. [Learn how to search for jobs](../../../how-to/search/).

### Save your search

You can save a search, which will save you time the next time you visit USAJOBS. When you save a search, we’ll automatically look for jobs that match what you’re looking for and email you, daily, weekly or monthly with those jobs.  [Learn how to save a search](../../../how-to/search/save/).

## 4. Review job announcement

If you find a job you’re interested in, read the entire announcement to make sure you’re [eligible and you meet the qualifications](../eligibility/difference-from-qualifications/). For each job there are specific qualifications –your application must show how you meet the required qualifications.

* Read the **This job is open to** section to see if you’re eligible to apply. 
* Read the **Clarification from the agency**, or the **Who may apply** sections for further eligibility details (not all job announcements will include this information). 
* Read the **Qualifications** section to see if you meet the job's qualifications. [Understand the job announcement](../../../how-to/job-announcement/).

Contact the agency representative if you have questions. The contact information is listed below the **How to apply** section of the job announcement.

## 4. Prepare your application in USAJOBS

Read the **How to Apply** section of the job announcement before starting your application. Click **Apply** to [start your application](../../../how-to/application/)—we’ll walk you through a five-step process where you’ll attach a resume and any required documents.  

During the application process you can review, edit, delete and update your information. We’ll automatically save your progress as you go, so you won’t lose any changes. [Learn how to create an application](../../../how-to/application/).

## 6. Submit application to agency

When your application is ready in USAJOBS, we’ll send you to the agency application system where you can submit your application. Before you submit, you may need to complete other agency-required steps such as:

* Providing more personal information.
* Providing more documentation.
* Answering eligibility questions.
* Completing an occupational questionnaire – look for a preview of the questions under the **Required documents** section.

It may take you longer to apply to some jobs than others, because some agencies and jobs require more information than others.

After you submit your application, go back to the **Application** section of your USAJOBS account and make sure the hiring agency received your application. Your application status will say **Received** if the application went through.

You can always [check the status of your application](../../../how-to/application/status/) in your USAJOBS profile. 

### How long will it take to receive an updated status?
It may take a few hours, after you submit your application, for the agency to update your application status. You may also receive an email confirmation from the agency application system, but not all agencies send email confirmations.

## 7. Agency reviews application

The hiring agency will start reviewing applications once the job announcement closes. The hiring agency will review your application to make sure you’re eligible and meet the job qualifications, and will place applicants into quality categories:

* Minimally qualified
* Highest qualified

The hiring agency may update your application status to **Reviewed**, but not all agencies provide this status.

After the hiring agency reviews all applications, they will send the highest qualified applicants to the hiring official—these applicants will see a **Referred** status in their application status. All other applicants (not being considered) will see a **Not Referred** status.

## 8. Interview

The hiring official will review the &quot;highest qualified&quot; applications and select applicants to interview based on agency policy. The hiring agency will contact applicants directly to schedule interviews.

Hiring officials can interview applicants using:

* A panel
* In-person
* Video
* Phone

There may be more than one interview round. For example, an applicant may have a phone interview and then an in-person interview.

### How long will it take to schedule an interview?
It may take some time to schedule interviews, depending on the number of people being interviewed.

## 9. Agency selects candidate

After the agency completes all of the interviews, they will select a candidate(s) and contact them to start the job offer process.
For those not selected, the hiring agency will update their application status to **Not Selected**.

## 10. Job offer

The hiring agency will extend a tentative job offer. Once this offer is accepted the agency will start the background investigation. The agency may require additional security checks for jobs that need a higher-level clearance.

### When is the job offer final?
The job offer is final when the agency successfully completes the background investigation and any additional security checks. The hiring agency will contact the candidate(s) directly to set up a start date.</content>

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/working-in-government/appointments/difference-from-private-sector/">## Eligibility

Eligibility, in the federal hiring process, refers to being part of a particular group of people that an agency wants to hire – whether it’s a current federal employee, a veteran, a recent graduate or someone from the general public. There are several different eligibilities in the Federal Government; we call them “hiring paths”. 

Your eligibility has nothing to do with your work experience, skills, and other qualifications. You can apply to any federal job, but you **may not be eligible** for the job if you don’t fall into one of the required hiring paths listed on the job announcement.  If you’re not eligible, the hiring agency will reject your application.

[Understand how eligibility is different from qualifications](../../../faq/application/eligibility/difference-from-qualifications/).

## Application process
The federal application process is very structured—the hiring agency must follow a specific review process and vetting system.  This process helps agencies hire the best qualified people, while being fair to all applicants. 

### Your resume and qualifications
Each job announcement lists the required qualifications for the job. Your resume must specifically describe how your knowledge, skills and experience meet these qualifications. Your resume is the only information the hiring agency will use to determine if you qualify for the job and the hiring agency will not make assumptions about what’s in your resume. Make sure you use similar words and phrases from the job announcement(s).  

The resume you use to apply to a federal job will likely require more information than the one you would use to apply to a private sector job—there’s a good chance your resume will exceed the commonly recommended two pages.   

[Learn more about what to include in your resume](../../../faq/application/documents/resume/what-to-include/).

### The review process 
Once you apply to a job, your application will go through a series of reviews.  Here’s a summary:

1. **Review for eligible and minimally qualified candidates** – the hiring agency will review all applications to see who is eligible AND minimally qualified and will pass those along to a second review.
2. **Review for best qualified candidates** – the hiring agency will identify the best qualified applicants. This is not a ranking. There could be 1, 10 or more people who are ‘best qualified’ and these applicants will go to the hiring manager for a third review.
3. **Review by hiring manager to select hires** – the hiring manager will review all best qualified applicants and decide who they want to interview.  After interviews, the hiring manager will decide who they want to hire.

[Learn more about the federal application process](../../../faq/application/process/).

### Merit System Principles
The Merit System Principles are nine standards governing the hiring and management of federal employees in the executive branch.  The principles help the government to:
1.	Be fair to all applicants and employees and provide open competition for employment.
2.	Protect employees from misuse of authority, political influence and other prohibited personnel practices.
3.	Steward the work performance of employees in the short and long-term.

[Learn more about the Merit System Principles](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/performance-management/reference-materials/more-topics/merit-system-principles-and-performance-management/).

## Appointment types
An “appointment” is how the federal government fills their jobs. There are two main categories of appointments; permanent and temporary. Appointments do not affect the number of hours per week you work. Rather, they tell you if there’s a specific end date to the job.

Permanent appointments have no specified end date. With a permanent appointment you can stay in the job until you decide to leave, retire, or are fired.

A temporary appointment has a specific end date—these appointments have a ‘not to exceed date’ from one year or less to four years. 

[Learn more about appointment types](../).

## Service types
The Federal Government has three services:

* Competitive
* Excepted
* Senior Executive

The hiring process and rules for each service is different.  And, once you’re a federal employee, [your service type affects your eligibility to apply to another job in another service](../../unique-hiring-paths/federal-employees/). You can move from service to service, but there are different rules and requirements you must follow.

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/faq/application/how-long/">First, it’s important to [understand the federal application and hiring process](../process/). Once you apply to a job, the hiring agency goes through many steps to review your application and make sure you’re eligible and qualified for the job.

The amount of time it takes to hire someone varies and it depends on the job you’re applying to, how many people have applied and the hiring agency. The hiring agency is responsible for evaluating applications and giving you a status at four points in the application process:

## 1. Application received
The hiring agency receives your application. However, the hiring agency will not look at your application until the job announcement closes.

## 2. Application reviewed
The hiring agency has reviewed your application. This may take some time depending on how many people have applied and when the job closed. 

## 3. Applicant referred or not referred
The hiring agency decides to send, or not send, your application to the hiring manager. If you’re eligible and qualified for the job, the agency will pass your application to the hiring manager, who will then do their own review of the applications and schedule an interview if needed. It may take some time to schedule an interview depending on the number of referred applicants. And, there may be more than one round of interviews.

## 4. Applicant selected or not selected
The hiring manager makes a decision to hire or not hire you.

You can [check the status of your application(s)](../../../how-to/application/status/) in your profile. 

## How long does it take once I get a federal job offer?
If you receive and accept a tentative job offer, it may take a few weeks to a few months before you start the job.  The background investigation and other security checks begin once you accept the offer. The length of these checks depends on the security clearance level of the job. Once the background investigation and additional security checks are done, the hiring agency will extend a final job offer and setup a start date.</content>

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/faq/application/qualifications/experience/">The amount of experience required varies for each job. Some jobs require no experience, while other jobs require years of specialized experience.

If you have questions related to how much experience you need for a particular job, review the **Job Requirements &gt; Qualifications** section of the job announcement. For additional questions, [contact the hiring agency](../../../../how-to/application/agency/contact/) listed in the job opportunity announcement.

## The basics

Like any employer, the Federal Government needs individuals to be well qualified for the jobs they hold. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) publishes qualification standards to help ensure federal employees can successfully and safely perform the work of the position. Whatever your background has been, it is likely that you are basically qualified for many different jobs, and highly qualified for some.

When meeting the basic eligibility requirements, the agency evaluates and then ranks your work experience, accomplishments, education, training, and overall qualifications background against the qualification requirements of the position. You will receive a score or ranking based on how closely your background matches with the requirements of the position. Job applicants who receive the highest scores or rank in the top category are referred to the selecting official.

## Qualifying with higher education

Some federal occupations require a college degree with a certain major field of study or completion of specific academic courses at the baccalaureate or graduate level. Such occupations tend to involve research, scientific or professional work (such as a specialist in contracts, medicine, engineering, biology, psychology, or accounting). To qualify, all college level courses must have been completed at a college or university that has obtained accreditation or pre-accreditation status from an accrediting body recognized by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education. The Human Resources staff at the agency advertising the job opportunity can advise you about your eligibility.

There are many occupations where a baccalaureate degree in any field is acceptable. Job applicants usually enter such occupations at the entry grade levels (typically GS-05 or GS-07 grade levels [or equivalent]) and acquire on-the-job training and work experience before advancing to higher grade levels. Such occupations are sometimes advertised as &quot;trainee,&quot; &quot;intern,&quot; or &quot;student program&quot; positions.

You may qualify for a GS-9 grade (or equivalent) level position on the basis of a master's degree, and for the GS-11 grade (or equivalent) level on the basis of a doctoral degree. At these levels, however, the advanced degree must be directly related to the work of the job to be filled.

Specialized experience, or experience closely related to the work to be performed in the job for which you are applying, can often be substituted for an educational requirement or qualify you for a higher grade. Generally, for jobs at the GS-7 grade (or equivalent) level and higher, your background must have included specialized experience. At least 1 year of the specialized experience must have been equivalent to the level of the next lower grade in the Federal service. This means, for example, to qualify for a GS-12 grade (or equivalent) level, you must have had a minimum of 1 year of specialized experience equivalent to a GS-11 grade (or equivalent) level.


## Qualifying for a non-degreed job

If you have been in the job market for awhile and have accumulated an extensive work history, you may be well qualified for many positions even without a college degree. Except for certain professional and scientific positions, a college education may not be necessary. The nature of your work experience is what really counts.

Job applicants can qualify for most federal occupations based on job-related work experience. If you are just starting out, you can qualify for jobs at the GS-2 level with just a high school diploma or as little as 3 months of general work experience for most clerical and assistant positions. &quot;General experience&quot; is a type of work experience that is not necessarily directly related to the position but demonstrates the ability to acquire the particular competencies/knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform the work of the position.

At higher grade (or equivalent) levels, additional work experience is required. Starting at the GS-5 grade (or equivalent) level, positions generally require 1 year of specialized experience equal to the next lower grade. “Specialized experience” is a type of work experience that is directly related to the position which you are applying. This means, for example, to qualify for a GS-6 grade (or equivalent) level, you must have had a minimum of 1 year of specialized experience equivalent to a GS-5 grade (or equivalent) level.


## Qualifying for Trade, Craft, and Labor jobs

Trade, Craft, and Labor jobs, sometimes referred to as &quot;blue collar&quot; jobs, have a separate qualification system from professional positions. Applicants for the apprenticeship programs for the various trades must demonstrate the potential to succeed in the job and the ability to complete classroom and on-the-job training. For journeyman or senior level jobs, applicants for trade jobs (for example, electronic equipment maintenance, electricians, plumbers, and carpenters) are rated against competencies/knowledge, skills, and abilities (commonly known as job elements) that are required for successful performance. Each trade has one or more critical job elements that applicants must meet to be rated basically eligible for the job. To be basically qualified, applicants must demonstrate mastery of the specified job elements through work experience, training, or tests.

### What is reinstatement?

You may be eligible for reinstatement if you held a career or career-conditional appointment in the federal government. Reinstatement allows former federal employees to re-enter the federal competitive service workforce without competing with the public. [Learn more about reinstatement](../../../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/federal-employees/reinstatement/).

## Not a federal employee

_I am not and have never been a federal civilian employee._

Select this option if you’ve never worked for the federal government. Working for a federal contractor does not qualify as working for the federal government.

If you select “Yes” to any of the federal employee options, you will get additional questions to answer about your federal service. These questions are optional.

## Current federal service

### Is your position in the competitive, excepted, or senior executive service?

You’ll only see this question, if you selected you’re a current federal employee. Choose one of the following:

### Have you accepted a buyout from a federal agency within the past 5 years?

You will see this question if you selected “Yes” to current or former federal employee. Some federal agencies may offer a buyout, also called a Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment (VSIP), to employees if the agency needs to downsize or restructure.
If you’ve accepted a buyout from a federal agency and then accept a new paid position with a federal agency within 5 years of the buyout, you’ll be required to pay the entire amount back to the agency that gave you the buyout (before you start the new job).

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/how-to/account/profile/experience/military/">In your profile, you must answer a few questions about your current or past military service.

## Have you served in the U.S. Armed Forces or are you a family member eligible for derived preference?

Select **No** if you’ve never served in the U.S. Armed Forces or you’re not a family member eligible for [derived preference](#what-is-derived-preference). If you answer no, the remaining military questions will disappear and you will not have to answer them.

### What is derived preference?

Derived preference is when a spouse, widow or widower, or parent of a veteran is eligible to claim Veterans’ Preference when the veteran is unable to use it. You’re not eligible for derived preference if you have any other relationship with the veteran or if the veteran is living and is qualified for federal employment.   [Learn more about derived preference](https://www.fedshirevets.gov/job-seekers/veterans-preference/family-member-preference/){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}.

## Do you claim Veterans’ Preference?

Veterans’ Preference gives eligible veterans preference over many other applicants in the hiring process. You can use Veterans’ Preference when applying to permanent and temporary positions in both the competitive and excepted service (of the executive branch). However, Veterans’ Preference does not guarantee you a job.

[Learn more about Veterans’ Preference](https://www.fedshirevets.gov/job-seekers/veterans-preference/){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}.

You must select one of the following options:

_No, I do not claim Veterans’ Preference_

Select this option if you don’t want to claim Veterans’ Preference.  Even if you’re a veteran, you do not have to claim preference.

_0-point preference - Sole Survivorship Preference (SSP)_

Select this option if you’re the only surviving child in a family where your mother or father or sibling(s) died, is captured or missing in action or is 100 percent disabled, while on active duty and NOT by intentional misconduct or willful neglect.   [Learn more about Sole Survivorship](https://www.fedshirevets.gov/job-seekers/veterans-preference/#0point){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}.

Select **Yes** if you’re a veteran who has served at least three continuous years and was discharged under honorable conditions. You may be eligible for a special hiring authority called Veterans Employment Opportunity Act of 1998 (VEOA).

### What is Veterans Employment Opportunity Act of 1998 (VEOA)?

VEOA is a hiring authority used to fill permanent, competitive service jobs. Under VEOA, eligible veterans can apply to jobs that are only open to “status” employees (i.e. jobs that are not offered to candidates outside of the federal government). [Learn more about VEOA](https://www.fedshirevets.gov/job-seekers/special-hiring-authorities/#veoa){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}.

## Tips for formatting resumes in USAJOBS resume builder

You can copy and paste text from Word documents into the resume builder. However, some formatting in these documents may not work in the USAJOBS resume builder. To fix formatting errors inside your resume, you must first save the original file in a .txt format.

To copy and paste from Word:

1. Open up your Word document or other word processing tool.
2. Select the **File** tab at the top.
2. Go to the **Save As** option.
3. Choose to save it as a **Plain Text (.txt)** file.
4. Open the new file and ensure the text appears in an acceptable format.
5. Copy and paste your resume text into the resume builder.

To edit your USAJOBS resume-builder resume:

1. Click on your username at the top of the page and select **Documents** from the menu.
2. Find the resume you want to edit and click &quot;Edit&quot; (located below the resume).
3. This will bring you to the first page of your resume.

## Tips for submitting resumes to agencies

Some agencies accept uploaded resumes and resumes created using the USAJOBS resume builder, while some may only accept one or the other. Even though you may have both types of resumes in the **Document** section of your profile, the agency determines which ones to accept when you are applying online. The **Apply** button displayed on the job announcement page activates the process for a job seeker to complete an application.

USAJOBS automatically provides a list of available resumes and other documents to attach to your application, and will only display resumes and documents the hiring agency is willing to accept. For example, if the hiring agency only accepts resumes created using the USAJOBS resume builder, then your uploaded resumes will not be available to add to your application. Please pay special attention to the **How to Apply** section of the job announcement to find out which resume format and documents are accepted and how to submit them to the hiring agency.</content>

    <id>/Help/how-to/application/agency/contact/</id>
    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/how-to/application/agency/contact/">Please reach out to the agency contact listed on the job announcement, if you have questions about a job. You can find agency contact information under the **How to Apply** section of every job announcement. 

If the job announcement has closed and no longer appears on the USAJOBS website, you can contact the hiring agency's Human Resources Office for additional information and assistance.

## When to contact the agency

It may take up to two weeks after a job has closed for the hiring agency to review all of the applications.  They may not have information about your application if you contact them too early. 

### Before the job closes
Contact the hiring agency with questions about:
* The job duties or details.
* The application process and what you need to provide or next steps.

Do not contact the hiring agency with questions about:
* Your qualifications for the job, before you apply to the job.
* Your application or documents—the agency doesn’t look at the applications until after the job closes.

### After the job closes
Contact the hiring agency with questions about:
* Your documents. Once the job is closed, wait a few hours before contacting the agency—all documents go through a virus scan before being sent to the hiring point of contact—this may take several hours to complete. 
* How long it will take to review all of the applications. Sometimes there are hundreds of applications to review for one job. The agency may be able to give you an estimate of the time it will take them to complete their review and a time to call back.
* Your application status. The agency has to review all applications before making a decision on whether or not your application will move onto the next step. The agency will try to answer your questions.

### What the hiring agency can’t answer at any time
* If you will get an interview—the hiring agency will contact you directly if you’ve been selected for an interview.
* The contact information for the person reviewing your application.  You will receive specific contact information if you’re selected for an interview. 
* How many people applied or who was selected for the job—the agency can’t disclose this information.</content>

You'll need to:

*	Create a login.gov account—you only need to do this once.
*	Enter an email address - use the same email address you use for USAJOBS (your primary or secondary email address), if you have an existing profile with us.
*	Create a new password.
*	Have a working phone number (mobile or landline) — login.gov will send you a security code.

Once you create a login.gov account, you'll come back to USAJOBS to link to your existing profile or create a new profile, if you don't have one.

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sign into USAJOBS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure all four sections of your profile (Contact, Eligibility, Demographics and Preferences) are up-to-date. During the application process some of this information is sent to the hiring agency.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find the job announcement you want to apply to – you can search for jobs by keyword or location, or use your &lt;strong&gt;Saved Searches&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thoroughly review the job announcement, including the &lt;strong&gt;How to Apply&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Required Documents&lt;/strong&gt; sections.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click &lt;strong&gt;Apply&lt;/strong&gt;. The USAJOBS application process will guide you through five steps:
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Select Resume&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Select Documents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;During the final step, you'll be asked  to certify that your application is true, complete, and made in good faith. If you answer YES, check the box and click &lt;strong&gt;Continue to Agency Site&lt;/strong&gt;. Select &lt;strong&gt;Previous&lt;/strong&gt; if you'd like to go back to review or edit your information.&lt;/li&gt;

A person's first legal name generally is the name of the person that was given for the purpose of registration of the birth and which then appears on a birth certificate, but may change subsequently. Most jurisdictions require the use of a legal name for all legal and administrative purposes, and some jurisdictions permit or require a name change to be recorded at marriage. The legal name may need to be used on various government issued documents (e.g., a court order). The term is also used when an individual changes their first or full name, typically after reaching a certain legal age (usually 18 or over).</content>

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/how-to/account/enter-international-phone-numbers/">When you create a login.gov account, you’ll be asked to enter a phone number where you can receive a security code. You can only receive the security code by SMS (text message), if you’re using an international phone number.

To enter an international phone number:

1. Select the country where your phone number is located - this will pre-populate the country code into the phone number field.
2. Check the phone number field to make sure the correct country code is showing.
3. Enter the remaining phone number digits into the phone number field - **DO NOT** enter the country code again and **DO NOT** enter the international prefix/dial out code (i.e. 00, 010, 011).
4. Click **Send security code** and follow the remaining steps.

If you have issues using an international phone number, because of limited access or cell service, you can [use an authentication application](../limited-access/) instead (once you create your login.gov account).</content>

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/how-to/account/profile/education/">Some federal jobs require that you have a college degree or specific coursework. You can find these requirements in the **Qualifications** section of the job announcement.

If you’re applying to a job with education requirements, you must include the required education and coursework information in your resume.  As you fill out your education information, you need to include: 

* Your degree (s)—it must be from an accredited academic institution. 
* The highest academic level you completed—include post-secondary courses, even if you don’t have a degree.
* A transcript if you’re using education to qualify for a job—the hiring agency may ask you for an unofficial transcript during the application process and an official transcript later.

You can add up to 50 entries for your education in your profile, or in our resume builder. If you want to add more, you’ll need to delete an existing entry.

## Education from an accredited academic institution

You must provide documentation or proof that your degree(s) is from a school accredited by an accrediting institution recognized by the Secretary, U.S. Department of Education, or that your education meets the other provisions outlined in the OPM Operating Manual.
If you completed your education outside of the U.S., you must provide proof its equivalent to accredited U.S. education programs.

[Learn more about education and training requirements](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-policies/#url=e4){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}.

### High school or equivalent

### Technical or occupational certificate

You’ve received training in a special skill to be used in a trade (i.e., mechanical, electrical, carpentry, etc.), or completed an organized program of study given by a recognized body or authority in a given subject area (i.e., MCSE, Java, CFA, Series 7, etc.)

### Associate degree

You’ve completed undergraduate studies and earned a 2-year degree at an accredited institution.

### Some college coursework completed

You’ve attended college but haven’t earned a degree, (include your total credits earned and  if those credits are semester or quarter hours.)

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/how-to/account/profile/experience/work/">List your relevant work, including any federal work experience. 

You can add and store up to 50 separate work experience entries. If you want to add more, you’ll have to delete an existing entry.

## Your work experience

For each work experience, include:

* Employer’s name
* Employer’s address
* Your job title 
* Start and end date
* Your duties, skills and accomplishments

You can also include (but aren’t required to include):
* Salary
* Currency of your salary
* Salary rate (is it bi-weekly, monthly, yearly, etc?)
* Average hours per week you worked
* Whether or not we can contact your supervisor

## What if I don’t want my current federal employer to see my resume?

If you make your resume searchable, federal HR specialists and hiring managers can search and see your resume and profile.  However, any work experience with an end date of “Present” will not be searchable or visible to these recruiters.

## How do I answer “Is this a Federal Civilian position”?

Federal experience includes positions you’ve held as a civilian employee paid by a federal agency.

Federal experience does NOT include any position as an active duty military member or a private contractor of the U.S. government. 

If you answer ‘yes’, you’ll see additional fields for the department and agency, series, pay scale, grade and appointment type.

## What do I include in the duties, accomplishments and skills section?

Describing your duties, accomplishments and skills can be challenging. Here are a few tips:

### Focus on your goals

Highlight the skills you possess, and how they relate to the field you want to enter and the job(s) you’re seeking. Think about your career goals. Then narrow your scope to the positions that will further those goals. Once your career goals are clear, it’ll be easier to describe your skills in a meaningful way.

### Review job announcements

Review relevant job descriptions to get an understanding of the requirements for the jobs you’re interested in. Then, relate those requirements to your own experience—list your matching skills, experience, training, and education. Use words and phrases from the job announcement(s) and include other commonly used technical terms.

### Describe your experience

Always include your current position, however only list past work experiences that show how your skills and duties relate to the type of job you’re seeking. Think about the projects you’ve worked on; what your specific duties were; what you needed to know to do the job; the tools, software, or equipment you used and what you accomplished.

### Include achievements and contributions

Did you ever have to list your accomplishments for performance reviews? If so, you can use those documents as a guide. If not, try listing your accomplishments from the last five years. Focus on challenges you met, problems you solved, results achieved, and any awards, promotions, and special benefits you received. It’s better to describe your accomplishments, than list your responsibilities. 

### Follow these writing tips

Keep your description concise, clear and organized. Use simple sentences that cite specific examples. Name any tool, software, or equipment you used, and any specialized knowledge you acquired. 

*Example*

**Don’t say**

‘Performed the full range of project management duties for a new information system,’ 

**Do say (using concrete examples)** 

‘Used Microsoft Project to develop timelines. Prepared budget requests; hired staff; selected vendors; negotiated contracts; designed and implemented a new UNIX client-server information system.’ 

Use action word phrases, such as:

* Designed and implemented new organizational structure plan.
* Negotiated contracts up to 90K.
* Delivered report on waste management.

When you’re finished, ask yourself the following questions:

* Would someone who's not familiar with my occupational background understand the kind of work I do?
* Is there nonessential information (nice to have, but not helpful in meeting mandatory qualification requirements) in what I have written?
* Have I omitted any relevant experience or skills I possess that might distinguish me from other candidates if my resume reaches the desk of a selecting official?
* Have I adequately described major characteristics of my occupation or background and skills that are most common to my occupation?</content>

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/how-to/search/filters/hiring-path/">Some federal jobs are open to the general public — meaning any U.S. citizen can apply. But, some federal jobs are only open to eligible current or former federal civilian employees or people who may be eligible under a unique hiring path. You can filter your job search results to only show you jobs that meet your specific eligibility criteria. You can filter by one or more hiring paths.

If you fall under one of the groups listed below, you may or may not be eligible for each job listed in your search results. You must read the **This job is open to** section of the job announcement to determine if you’re eligible to apply.  You can also read the **Who May Apply** section, but not all job announcements have that information.

## Open to the public

If you select this option, you will only see jobs open to the general public.

Select this option if you’ve never worked for the federal government and you're a:

* U.S. citizen or
* National or individual who owes allegiance to the U.S.

### Who is a National or individual who owes allegiance to the U.S.?  

Most federal jobs require you to be a [U.S. citizen](../../../../working-in-government/us-citizens/), but there are some exceptions for [nationals and individuals who owe allegiance to the U.S.](https://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-9696.html){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}, including those from the American Samoa and Swain Islands. The **Who May Apply** section of each job announcement lists whether the job is open to U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizens.

[Learn more about employment of non-U.S. citizens](../../../../working-in-government/non-citizens/).

## Federal employees

Select this option to see jobs open to current or former federal employees. You may also see jobs open to current agency employees – an agency may post a job that is only open to current agency employees. You must read the **Who May Apply** section to find out if you’re eligible to apply.

Select this option if you're:

### A current or former federal civilian employee

* Who holds or held a [non-temporary appointment](../../../../working-in-government/appointments/).
* In the [competitive service](../../../../working-in-government/service/) in the Executive branch or in a position not in the Executive branch specifically included in the competitive service by statute.
* In an [excepted service](../../../../working-in-government/service/) position covered by an [interchange agreement](../../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/federal-employees/interchange-agreements/).
* Eligible for [reinstatement](../../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/federal-employees/reinstatement/).

As a current of former federal employee, you can also apply to jobs that are open to the public.

[Learn more about the federal employee hiring path](../../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/federal-employees/).

## Internal to an agency

Select this option if you're interested in staying within your agency:

* Jobs open within the [competitive service](../../../../working-in-government/service/) are open to current competitive service employees or those with a disability covered by schedule A.
* Jobs open in the [excepted service](../../../../working-in-government/service/) are open to anyone within the agency. This also includes employees who can be [reinstated](../../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/federal-employees/reinstatement/).

[Learn more about the internal to an agency hiring path](../../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/federal-employees/internal/).

## Veterans
Select this option if you're:

* Eligible for [veterans' preference](../../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/veterans/preference/) or
* Separated from the armed forces under honorable conditions after three years or more, of continuous military service.

[Learn more about the veterans’ hiring path](../../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/veterans/).

## Students and recent graduates
If you’re a current student or have recently graduated in the past two years, you may be eligible for federal internships and job opportunities through the Pathways Program.  Select this option to see internships and Pathways Program jobs.

[Learn more about the students and recent graduates hiring path](../../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/students/).

## Individuals with disabilities
If you’re an individual with a disability you can apply and compete for any job that you’re eligible for and meet the qualifications.  However, some jobs offer the Schedule A hiring path.  Schedule A gives federal agencies an optional, potentially faster, way to hire individuals with disabilities. Select this option to see jobs that offer the Schedule A hiring path.

[Learn more about the individuals with a disability hiring path](../../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/individuals-with-disabilities/).

## Family of overseas employees

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/how-to/search/filters/work-schedule/">You can filter your results by one or more of the following [work schedules](../../../../working-in-government/pay-and-leave/work-schedules/). 

## Full-time
A full-time job requires most employees to work 40 hours per work week.  There may be slight variations in this schedule.

## Part-time
A part-time job requires most employees to work less than 40 hours per work week.  The number of hours may vary depending on the job.

## Shift-work
Shift-work requires coverage 24 hours per day, and sometimes 7 days per week.  A shift-work job means you’ll work during a set period of time within that 24 hour period. You may work a night shift, morning shift or you may rotate shifts with other workers.  The exact schedule may vary depending on the job.

## Intermittent
An intermittent job requires you to work from time to time – there is no set schedule.  This is not the same as a part-time job.

## Job sharing
A job share job requires you to share a full-time job with another employee.  You and the other employee share the full-time job responsibilities and receive salary and benefits on a pro-rated basis. Each job sharer can work up to 32 hours per week. 

## Multiple
A job with multiple work schedules usually means there is more than one position that can be filled and the work schedules may vary.

However, some formatting in these documents may not work in the USAJOBS resume builder. To correct any formatting errors inside your announcement, you must first save the original file in a .txt format.

To do this, go to the **Save As** option in Word and then choose to save the document as a &quot;Plain Text (*.txt)&quot; file. Open the new file and ensure the text appears in an acceptable format and then copy and paste your resume text into the resume builder.</content>

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/how-to/account/profile/searchable/">Making your resume searchable adds it to the USAJOBS Resume Mining collection. HR specialists and hiring managers from federal agencies use resume mining to look for people (with a searchable resume in their USAJOBS profile) to fill their job vacancies. 

Plus, when your resume is searchable and you have completed your profile, your profile is searchable too.

Keep in mind:

* You can only make one resume searchable at a time.
* Only certain formats are searchable including Word, text based pdfs, text files and resumes created using our Resume Builder tool.
* Your resume will only remain searchable for 18 months unless it is renewed.
* Your profile will be searchable too, if it’s complete.


## Why make my resume and profile searchable?
HR specialists and hiring managers can search your resume and profile to match your work preferences and background with the jobs they’re trying to fill. 

To make your resume searchable:

1. Sign into USAJOBS and go to your **Profile**.
2. Go to **Documents**–your resumes will appear in your **Documents**.
3. Click the **Searchable** checkbox on the resume you want to make searchable—if your profile is complete, it will become searchable too.

If you want to remove your resume from the Resume Mining collection, deselect the **Searchable** checkbox.</content>

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/how-to/account/documents/">If you have a USAJOBS profile, you can upload and manage your resume, required forms, and other documents.

1. Sign into USAJOBS.
2. Click the **Documents** link located in the left-hand navigation.
3. Select **Resumes** or **Other Documents** located at the top of the page.

## Manage your resumes

You can upload and store up to five resumes in your profile. Here is what you can do:

### Edit your resume

There are two ways you can edit your resume(s).

1. If you created your resume with the Resume Builder tool, you can edit it directly in the tool.
2. If you uploaded your resume from your computer, you must re-upload the edited document.[Learn how to edit your resume](resume/edit/).

### Delete a resume

You may need to delete a resume if you want to upload a new resume, but already have five in your profile.  When you delete a resume, it will be completely removed from your profile.

### Make a resume searchable

You can make your resume searchable, so your profile and resume will be visible to recruiters searching our resume bank. [Learn more about making a resume searchable](resume/searchable/).

### Upload a resume or create a resume

You can [upload a resume](resume/upload/) or [use our Resume Builder to build one](resume/build/). Resumes must be less than 3MB in size. You can upload in the following formats:

* GIF
* JPG
* JPEG
* PNG
* RTF
* PDF
* TXT
* Word (.doc or .docx)

If you upload a resume, we recommend writing your resume using Word because you can make it searchable to recruiters in our resume bank.

Learn [what to include](../../../faq/application/documents/resume/what-to-include/) and [what not to include](../../../faq/application/documents/resume/what-to-leave-out/) in a resume.

## Manage forms and other documents

You may need to upload forms or other documents, such as a [DD-214](../../../faq/application/documents/#dd-214), [SF-15](../../../faq/application/documents/#sf-15), [cover letters](../../../faq/application/documents/#cover-letter) or [transcripts](../../../faq/application/documents/#transcripts), as part of the application process. You can edit, delete, and upload documents.

All documents must be less than 3MB in size and in one of the following document formats:

* GIF
* JPG
* JPEG
* PNG
* RTF
* PDF
* TXT
* Word (.doc or .docx)

If you make changes to a document, you'll need to upload the updated version of the file to your profile.  However, some forms can’t be edited, except for the file name or document type.

## Search for a single keyword

When you enter a single keyword, we’ll look for all jobs that contain the keyword.  We’ll display the most relevant jobs first. For example, if the keyword appears in the job title, we’ll display those jobs first.

## Search for multiple keywords

When you enter more than one keyword, we’ll look for jobs that contain all of the keywords together. Each of the keywords you enter must exist in the job announcement for that announcement to be returned. For example, if you enter &quot;program analyst&quot;, we’ll look for jobs that contain both program and analyst together.

## Search for an exact match

You can use quotations to help you search for an exact match. For example, if you search for “physical fitness”, we’ll only show jobs that include the words “physical fitness” side-by-side.</content>

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/how-to/application/status/">1.	Sign into USAJOBS.
2.	Go to your **Applications**, located on your **Home** page — your active applications display automatically.
3.	Review your list of applications. Your applications are listed by the date they were last updated.
4.	The application status is highlighted next to each job application.
5.	Click the **+** to see more application details.

You can also [find and filter your applications](#how-to-find-and-filter-applications).

## What does each status mean?

Each status tells you where your application is within the application process—whether it’s been received, reviewed, selected, not-selected and more.

### Advancing

The job application has been received by the hiring agency and is being considered for employment.

**Received**

The hiring agency has received your job application.

**Reviewed**

The hiring agency has reviewed your job application, but has not yet determined if you're qualified.

**Referred**
Your application is among the best qualified and is referred to the next step in the selection process.

**Selected**

The hiring agency has offered you a position.

**Hired**

You have accepted the position.

### Paused

The job application has not been completed and requires further action.

**In Progress**

The application has been started, but not completed or submitted yet. If the job is still open, you should complete the application and submit.

**Incomplete**

The application is not complete. You may not have completed submitting your application in the application system or you may not have submitted the required documents, such as the DD-214. If the job is still open, you can update the application and submit.

### Stopped

Your application is no longer being considered for the job or the agency canceled the job. Applications with this status will automatically archive three months after the last status update.

**Canceled**

The job announcement has been withdrawn without anyone being hired. A job announcement can be canceled any time after the job is posted.

**Not Referred**

Your application is not among the best qualified and has not been referred to the next step in the selection processes.

**Not Selected**

You have not been selected for the position.

**Not Hired**

You were not offered the position or you declined the offer.

### Unknown

We can’t determine the status of the job application.

**Unavailable**

There are a few reasons why an unavailable status may appear:

* We did not receive confirmation from the hiring agency that your resume was received, or that your application was complete.
* You may not have completed the application process.
* You may not have properly logged out.
* The hiring agency’s system did not return your status to USAJOBS.

## Are there status delays for faxed documents?

Yes. If you [fax a resume or any other documents](../../account/documents/fax/), there may be a delay between when the documents are faxed and when they appear as received on an application. If you have questions about the status of your faxed documents, [contact the hiring agency](../agency/contact/).

## How long can you keep your applications?

We will permanently remove all applications (active and archived) 36 months after the closing date, regardless of the application status. We recommend printing the announcements for which you have applied if you wish to keep a record of them beyond the 36 month period.

## How to find and filter applications  

You can find and filter your active and archived job applications by status—this is the status the hiring agency reports to USAJOBS.

### Filtering

1.	Choose either your **Active** or **Archived** application list.
2.	Click **Find &amp;amp; filter applications**.
3.	Select at least one of the status checkboxes. You can select more than one status at a time.
4.	Review your applications list – the applications will automatically filter based on your selection.

* The number next to each status tells you how many of your applications have that status.
* A brief description of each status appears if you place your cursor on top of the status (For example, place your cursor on top of Received to reveal the description).

### Finding

1.	Choose either your **Active** or **Archived** application list.
2.	Click **Find &amp;amp; filter applications**.
3.	Enter a job title, agency or job announcement number into the search field and click the search icon or press return.
4.	Review your applications list.

## Have questions about your status?

The hiring agency sends the status to USAJOBS. USAJOBS does not have any control over the status or lack of a status. If you think you’ve received an incorrect status or have questions about your status, please [contact the staffing point of contact on the job announcement](../agency/contact/).</content>

    <link href="/Help/how-to/account/documents/resume/build/education/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to supply education" />
    <published>2017-03-13T16:51:56-04:00</published>
    <updated>2017-03-13T16:51:56-04:00</updated>
    <id>/Help/how-to/account/documents/resume/build/education/</id>
    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/how-to/account/documents/resume/build/education/">Some Federal positions have education requirements, such as a specific degree or coursework. You can find these requirements in the Qualifications section of the job announcement.

If you’re applying to a job with education requirements, you must include the required education and coursework information in your resume. Your degree must be from an accredited academic institution. When education is used to qualify for a position, a Federal agency will ask you to provide a transcript when you apply to a job or upon tentative selection. If you have no degree, but have completed post-secondary courses, you should still provide that information.

## Academic Level and School Information

You must provide documentation or proof that your degree(s) is from a school accredited by an accrediting institution recognized by the Secretary, U.S. Department of Education, or that your education meets the other provisions outlined in the OPM Operating Manual.

Education completed outside of the U.S. must be equivalent to accredited U.S. education programs.

[Learn more about education and training requirements](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-policies/#url=e4){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}.

    <updated>2017-08-31T15:48:16-04:00</updated>
    <id>/Help/how-to/account/documents/resume/build/experience/</id>
    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/how-to/account/documents/resume/build/experience/">In this section you'll enter your relevant work experiences. If your resume is confidential, any work experience with an end date of 'present' will not be visible to Federal recruiters performing resume searches. To complete this section, enter information and click 'add work experience.

See below for additional information on selected fields:

## Employee Information

Please enter the company or agency name; your formal job title (e.g., Database Administrator); start and end date; and ending salary.

## Is this a Federal Civilian position?

Federal experience includes positions you have held as a civilian employee paid by an agency of the Federal government. The pay plan, series, and grade fields refer to Executive Branch &lt;span data-term=&quot;Competitive Position&quot;&gt;competitive positions&lt;/span&gt; and are not mandatory fields. If your experience does not fit, simply leave those fields blank.

Active duty military members or experience working for a private contractor of the U.S. government do not qualify as Federal positions for this purpose.

## Duties, Accomplishments and Related Skills

Describing your duties, accomplishments and related skills can be challenging. To help you do this more effectively, take a minute to review the suggestions included below.

## Focus On Your Goals

Your resume should showcase the skills you possess, and how they relate to the field you want to enter and the job(s) you are seeking. Think about your career goals. Then narrow your scope to the positions that will further those goals. Once your career goals are clear, it will be easier to describe your skills in a meaningful way.

## Review Job Announcements

Before you describe your own duties, accomplishments, and skills, try reviewing relevant job descriptions. Once you have an understanding of the competencies required for the jobs you are interested in, you can relate those requirements to your own experience. After reviewing the descriptions, list your matching skills, experience, training, and education. Use words and phrases used in the announcements. Incorporate other commonly used technical terms.

## Describe Your Experience

When listing your past jobs, concentrate on experiences that are relevant to your career goals and the position you are applying to. For instance, if you had a summer clerical job and you are looking to apply for a professional position, you do not need to list that job. With the exception of your current position, omit any job that does not show how your skills and experiences relate to the type of position you are seeking. Think about the projects you worked on; what your specific duties were; what you needed to know to do the job; the tools, software, or equipment you used; what you accomplished.

## Include Achievements and Contributions

Did your supervisor require that you list your accomplishments for performance reviews? If so, you can use those documents as a guide. If not, try listing your accomplishments from the last five years. Focus on challenges you met, problems you solved, results achieved, and any awards, promotions, and special benefits you received. It's better to describe your accomplishments, than list your responsibilities. Writing Tips

When writing about a work experience, keep your description concise, clear and organized. Use simple sentences that cite specific examples. Name any tool, software, or equipment you used, and any specialized knowledge you acquired. Instead of saying, 'Performed the full range of project management duties for a new information system,' use concrete examples: 'Used Microsoft Project to develop timelines. Prepared budget requests; hired staff; selected vendors; negotiated contracts; designed and implemented a new UNIX client-server information system.' Use action word phrases (e.g., designed and implemented new organizational structure plan; negotiated contracts up to 90K; delivered report on waste management).

When you're finished, ask yourself the following questions:

* Would someone who is not familiar with my occupational background understand the kind of work I do?
* Is there nonessential information (nice to have, but not helpful in meeting mandatory qualification requirements) in what I have written?
* Have I omitted any relevant experience or skills I possess that might distinguish me from other candidates if my resume reaches the desk of a selecting official?
* Have I adequately described major characteristics of my occupation or background and skills that are most common to my occupation?</content>

A valid phone number is a number that connects to a working telephone line.

## Formats

* **U.S. Phone Number**: XXX-XXX-XXXX
* **International Phone Number**: +X-XXX-XXX-XXXX - When phone numbers are published for use abroad they typically include the country calling code, but replace the international call prefix with &quot;+&quot; to signify that the caller should use the prefix appropriate for their country.</content>

    <id>/Help/how-to/job-announcement/closing-types/</id>
    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/how-to/job-announcement/closing-types/">When a job announcement closes, it means you can no longer apply to the job.

Job announcements can close in one of three ways:

## Closing date

Most job announcements close on the closing date that's in the job announcement.

## Open continuous

Some job announcements stay open indefinitely. You can submit your application at any time, but the job announcement will usually include a date (or several dates) when the hiring agency will select a group of applicants to review.

For example, the job announcement may say it will review applications on July 30, August 30 and so on. If you submit an application on August 1, the hiring agency will review your application starting on August 30.

## Applicant cut-off

Some job announcements close when the hiring agency receives a certain number of applications. If the 'cut-off' number is reached during the day, the job announcement will usually close that night at midnight.

For example, a job announcement may say it will close after the hiring agency receives 200 applications. If they receive 200 applications by 1:30pm EDT, the job will close that same day at 12am EDT.</content>

    <id>/Help/how-to/search/results/</id>
    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/how-to/search/results/">The search results page displays all jobs that match the criteria you provide in a search. You can narrow your results using the filters on the right side of the page and save your results using the **Save this search** link at the top of the results page.

## View your search results and descriptions
The search results will display the first 10 results. Additional search results will display on multiple pages. Use the numbers displayed below your search results to move from page to page.

Each result displays a quick overview of the job, including:

### Job title
This is the name the Federal Government uses to identify the job– it may be different from the name of a similar job in the private sector. Click on the job title to open the complete job announcement.

### Agency and department
The agency name displays under the job title and the department name displays under the agency name.  The department is the highest level of the agency. For example, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services. Not all job announcements will list a department.

### Work location(s)
Some jobs are available in multiple locations. You need to open the full job announcement to see all of the locations.

### Open and close dates
Every job has an open date and a close date.  You must apply during that time period.  The open period time varies from job to job.

### Salary and grade
Each job result will show the starting salary or an hourly rate. The Federal Government offers many pay systems. The most common pay system is the General Schedule (GS). For the GS pay system, the starting salary is based on the lowest &lt;span data-term=&quot;Grade&quot;&gt;grade&lt;/span&gt; advertised. You can see the entire salary range in the full job announcement.  [Learn more about pay and grade](../filters/pay).

### Appointment type
Federal jobs are classified into appointment types, such as permanent, temporary, term, detail, recent graduate and others. The appointment type often determines the length of employment, benefits and the ability to move to another federal job or re-enter the federal workforce. [Learn more about appointment types](../../../working-in-government/appointments/).

### Work schedule
There are many different work schedules, including full-time, part-time, intermittent, or multiple.  [Learn more about work schedules](../../../working-in-government/pay-and-leave/work-schedules/).

### Hiring path icons
The icons represent who is eligible to apply.  Some jobs are only open to current or former federal employees.  Other jobs are open to Veterans, and so on. Move your mouse cursor over an icon to see who is eligible to apply.

## Sort your search results
By default the most relevant search results are displayed at the top. You can change the order of your results by using the **Sort by** drop down. You can sort by:

* Relevance – this is the default.
* Close date
* Open date
* Agency
* Department
* Location
* Job title
* Salary

[Learn more about sorting results](../sort/).

## Save your search
You can save a search by clicking **Save this Search** at the top of the search results page. If you’re not signed in, you’ll be taken to the sign in screen first. When you save a search, you can sign up for email notifications and we’ll email you new jobs that match what you’re looking for.  You can manage your saved searches in your profile.

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/how-to/job-announcement/overview/">The details at the top of the job announcement tell you how long you have to apply, the salary, work schedule and the type of appointment and service.
 
**Open and closing date**

The open date is the first day you can submit an application to the job. The closing date is the last day you can submit an application for the job—you can’t submit an application after 11:59pm EST (Eastern Standard Time) on that date.
 
**Pay scale and grade**

This tells you the type of pay system. The Federal Government has different pay systems, which helps determine the salary. [Learn more about pay scales and grade](../../../working-in-government/pay-and-leave/).
  
**Appointment type**

The appointment type tells you how long the job will last. Permanent jobs don’t have a time-limit. Temporary jobs do have a time-limit, which could be two years, four years or some other amount of time. [Learn more about appointment types](../../../working-in-government/appointments/).

**Service**

There are three different services in the Federal Government; Competitive, Excepted and Senior Executive. Each service type has different rules for how they classify jobs and hire and pay employees. [Learn more about service types](../../../working-in-government/service/).
 
**Salary**

Each job announcement shows the starting salary and sometimes it will show a salary range. [Learn more about salaries](../../../working-in-government/pay-and-leave/).
 
**Work schedule**

This tells you how often you will work. [Learn more about work schedules](../../../working-in-government/pay-and-leave/work-schedules/).</content>

## Number of vacancies per location
Some jobs have more than one vacancy per location.  The number of vacancies is listed under each location.

This tells you if the job will pay for you to relocate. Each agency has different rules for reimbursing, so it’s important to ask the hiring agency which expenses are covered.

## Telework eligible
This tells you if the job has an option for telework.  Many federal jobs offer the chance to work from home. The work schedule and telework frequency depend on the agency and the job duties. Even if you see a “yes”, this does not guarantee you will have the option to work from home.</content>

## Additional information

* Job announcements that are  “open” are still accepting new applications and updated applications.
* Job announcements that are “closed” are no longer accepting applications or updates to previously submitted applications.
* If you want to update your application with a newer version of your resume or documents or new profile information, you must resubmit the application with the changes- simply updating the information in your USAJOBS account does not &quot;submit&quot; the changes.
* If you resubmit your application with a newer resume or document, your application may continue to display both old and new information. The agency will review your most recent submission and provide a date/time stamp next to each attachment. Agencies have certain legal requirements for records retention; however, you may request that the agency remove you from consideration or accept changes or additions to your application by contacting the agency representative listed on the job announcement.</content>

If your document is larger than 3 MB, here are some suggestions:

* Read Adobe’s tutorial on [how to reduce PDF file size](https://acrobatusers.com/tutorials/reducing-file-size){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}.
* Print your document, scan it (if you have a personal scanner) and save it at a smaller size.
* Use a smaller image format. Different image formats have varying sizes – JPEG files typically are the largest and PNG files are the smallest.
* Take your document to an office supply store (i.e. Staples, FedEx Office/Kinkos) and ask them to shrink the document size for you and save it to a disk or flash drive. Make sure you tell the office tech the document can’t exceed 3MB (3,072 KB).

**Transcripts**
Sometimes transcripts from an educational institution will have a security block that is flagged as a virus and makes the file very large—this prevents the file from being uploaded. If that happens, you need to print your transcript and scan it in to upload.

## Do all agencies accept uploaded documents?
Not all agencies accept uploaded documents from USAJOBS.  If the agency does not accept uploaded documents, you will skip this step during the USAJOBS application process.  You may be asked to upload a document when you enter the agency application system.

## Additional information

* Documents uploaded during the Select Documents step of the USAJOBS application process will automatically be added to the **Other Documents** section of your profile.
* Only attach the documents specifically requested by the job announcement to which you are applying.</content>

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/how-to/account/limited-access/">You only need to use a phone for the initial setup of your login.gov account - creating the account is a one-time step. We recommend you create your login.gov account when you do have cell phone service or find a phone only for initial account creation purposes.

Once you've successfully created your account, you can sign in either with your personal key or using an authentication app.

### Use an authentication application to generate a login.gov security code

After creating your login.gov account, you can set up an authentication application to generate security codes. If you want to use this option, **DO NOT** sign out of your new login.gov account until you have set up the authentication application.

1. Choose a device, such as a computer, or mobile device (phone or tablet), on which you can install apps.
2. Download and install one of the following authentication apps to the device:
  *	Android options: Google Authenticator, Authy, LastPass, 1Password
  * iOS options: Google Authenticator, Authy, LastPass, 1Password
  * Windows apps: 1Password, OTP Manager, OneLogin OTP
  * Mac apps: 1Password, OTP Manager
  * Chrome extensions: SecureAuth OTP, Authenticator
3. Log in to your login.gov account at &lt;a href=&quot;https://secure.login.gov/&quot;&gt;https://secure.login.gov/&lt;/a&gt;
4. Select &quot;enable&quot; next to Authentication app and follow the instructions to scan or enter a code associating your authentication app with your account.

You will now be able to use the one time passcodes generated by the application each time you sign in instead of receiving an SMS (text messages) or phone call.

## Use your login.gov personal key

This option is always available with no additional software. After creating your login.gov account, you can also use your login.gov personal key. NOTE: You will be given a new personal key every time you use it to sign in. If you plan to use your personal key each time you sign in, you must always use the newest version of it.

1.	Sign in at login.gov with your email address and password.
2.	On the &quot;Enter your security code&quot; page, select &quot;Use a personal key instead.&quot;
3.	Follow the instructions to enter your personal security code.</content>

    <id>/Help/how-to/application/view/</id>
    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/how-to/application/view/">When you sign in to your USAJOBS profile, you’ll see a list of your job applications.  Any job application you create on USAJOBS is automatically saved to your profile &amp;mdash; this includes complete, incomplete and archived applications.

## Active vs. archived applications
Job applications are grouped into active and archived. Active applications are applications you’re currently working on or waiting to hear back on. Archived applications are applications you want to keep, but may not want to see if your active list.

You’ll only see the 10 most recent applications, but you can choose to display more.

## What’s in the job application listing?

Each job application listing gives a quick summary of the position, the status of your application, and if you need to complete or update the application. Here’s what you can do:

### Sort your applications
Your applications are listed from newest to oldest by default, but you can sort by:

* Last updated
* Agency
* Job title
* Closing date
* Status

### Receive email notifications
You can receive emails to let you know if the status of your job application changes, or if a job, that you applied to, is closed. To get email notifications, click on the Notifications icon and select which email(s) you want to receive.


### View job announcement information

Click the **+** to see more details about the job application. Each application has a summary including:

* Position title
* Hiring agency
* Job location(s)
* Closing date
* Last updated date
*	[Work schedule](../../../working-in-government/pay-and-leave/work-schedules/)
*	[Series and grade](../../../faq/pay/series-and-grade/)
*	[Salary range](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}

[Learn more about the job announcement](../../job-announcement/).

### View the status of your application

Each application is labeled with a status to indicate its progress through the federal application process.  These statuses will tell you if your application is in progress, received, canceled, incomplete or unavailable.  [Understand the different application statuses](../status/).

### Update or complete your application

Depending on the status of your job application, and if the job is still accepting applications, you may see a button to **Update Application** or **Continue Application**.

You may need to [continue an application](../continue/), if it’s still in progress and you haven’t submitted it yet.

You may need to [update an application](../update/) if it was rejected as incomplete or if the job is still open and you want to add more information.

### Archive

You can archive a job application to save it for your personal records and get it out of your active list. [Learn how to archive an application](../archive).</content>

* You're a current federal employee in the excepted service (serving on a permanent appointment, not time-limited).
* Your agency has an interchange agreement with the agency where you want to apply.

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/students/transcripts/">An official transcript is a copy of your permanent academic record and includes:

*	A list of the courses you took.
*	The dates you attended the school.
*	Your major and degree.
*	Your cumulative grade point average (GPA).
*	Any honors you received.
*	The date your degree was awarded.

## Can I submit an unofficial copy of my transcript?

The job announcement will tell you if you can submit a 'copy' or 'unofficial copy' of your transcript or if it needs to be a 'certified copy'. Most of the time it's okay to submit an unofficial copy of your transcript when you first apply to the job.  If you get further along in the application process, you may need to submit a 'certified official' and unopened copy from your academic institution.  

## How do I request a transcript?
To request a transcript, first visit your school's website. You may be able to complete your request online. If your college doesn’t offer this service, contact the  Registrar’s Office. The Registrar’s Office may require specific personal information before sending you the transcript. You may need to provide:

*	Your full name and handwritten signature.
*	Your social security number or student ID number.
*	Your current address and phone number.
*	The dates you attended the school or your graduation date.
*	The  address where you want your transcript to be mailed.

Your college may charge a small fee to mail you your transcript.</content>

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/working-in-government/pay-and-leave/">The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) maintains pay tables for General Schedule employees, manages the Federal Wage System, and provides government-wide regulations and policies leave and other pay systems.

## Salary
Typically there is a minimum and maximum salary for every job – federal agencies determine a salary based on their pay setting rules (the pay grade or other pay schedule) and your qualifications.

## Hourly wage
Some federal jobs offer hourly wages. These jobs follow the Federal Wage System (FWS).

## Pay scale
A General Schedule (GS) pay scale is one of many pay systems in the Federal Government. A GS pay grade is a rate of basic pay based on the specific level of work or range of difficulty, responsibility, and qualifications.

The GS pay schedule has 15 pay grades and 10 steps in each grade. A salary can vary within a pay grade depending if you’re at step 1 (the starting salary) or step 10 (the maximum salary). If you’re new to the government, your pay will likely be set at the starting salary for the pay grade for which you are selected.

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/working-in-government/service/SF-50/">If you don't know which service you're in or your appointment type, you can refer to your SF-50 (Notification of Personnel Action).

## How to find your SF-50

Many agencies use OPM's electronic Official Personnel Folder (eOPF) tool, which is an online system for managing personnel documents. Agencies that use eOPF have their own URL. For example, OPM's eOPF can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://eopf.opm.gov/opm/&quot;&gt;https://eopf.opm.gov/opm/&lt;/a&gt;, whereas the Social Security Administration's eOPF can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://eopf.opm.gov/ssa/&quot;&gt;https://eopf.opm.gov/ssa/&lt;/a&gt;. The eOPF tool is often only accessible from your agency's internal network.

However, not all agencies use the eOPF tool. Ask your Human Resources department if you're not sure where to find your SF-50.


## How to read your SF-50

### Your appointment type

#### Tenure - Block 24

On your SF-50, look for Block 24 named &quot;Tenure&quot;. You may see a 0, 1, 2, 3 or asterisk.

* A **0** indicates that you may be in the [Senior Executive Service](../../service#senior-executive-service) or appointed by the President subject to Senate confirmation. You may also be in a group that is not defined in [The Guide to Data Standards](http://www.opm.gov/feddata/guidance.asp).
* A **1** indicates that you're a [permanent, career employee](../../appointments#career-appointment) and have completed three years of service.
* A **2** indicates that you're a [career-conditional employee](../../appointments#career-conditional-appointment). You're in a permanent position, but you haven't completed three years of service yet and may still be in your probation period.
* A **3** indicates that may be on a [temporary or term appointment](../../appointments#temporary-appointments).
* An asterisk indicates that you were appointed through a specific hiring authority that deviates from the above. 

Ask your Human Resources department for more information if you're unsure about what's in your Tenure block.
 

### Your service type

#### Position occupied - Block 34

Look at Block 34 named &quot;Position occupied&quot;. You may see a 1, 2, 3, 4 or asterisk.

* A **1-Competitive Service** indicates you're in the [Competitive service](../../service#competitive-service).
* A **2-Excepted Service** indicates you're in the [Excepted service](../../service#excepted-service).
* A **3-SES General** indicates you're in the [Senior Executive service](../../service#senior-executive-service).
* A **4-SES Career Reserved** indicates you're in the [Senior Executive service](../../service#senior-executive-service).

If you have an asterisk or questions about Block 34, ask your Human Resources department to tell you the service type.

### Exceptions
The Department of Defense and other agencies have exceptions to these rules. For example:

* If you have **Tenure: 0** and **Position occupied: 1**, you're a current temporary employee.
* If you have **Tenure: 3** and **Position occupied: 1**, you're a current term employee.

If you see a combination of numbers you don't understand, ask your Human Resources department.</content>

&lt;/h2&gt;

The Selective Service System is an independent agency within the Executive Branch of the U.S. Federal Government. It's mission is &quot;&amp;hellip;To furnish manpower to the Defense Department during a national emergency, to manage alternative service for men classified as conscientious objectors, and to register, with only a few exceptions, all male U.S. citizens and male immigrants residing in the United States who are ages 18 through 25&amp;hellip;&quot;

You can update your Selective Service status in [your USAJOBS profile](../../../how-to/account/profile/).

If you're hired, you will need to provide your selective service registration information during your on-boarding process. You can find this information by calling the Selective Service registration information line at 1-847-688-6888 or at [https://www.sss.gov/Registration/Check-a-Registration/Verification-Form](https://www.sss.gov/Registration/Check-a-Registration/Verification-Form).</content>

You will not have to compete against the general public.  Your transfer eligibility does not guarantee you will get the job – you will still compete against other federal employees who apply and you must meet the qualifications and other requirements.

If you transfer to another job, you’ll keep your &quot;time in service&quot; as long as you start the new job without missing a day of work.

The competitive examination, which is open to all applicants, may consist of a written test, an evaluation of an applicant’s education and experience, and/or an evaluation of other attributes necessary for successful performance in the position to be filled. The process is used to fill civil service positions with candidates who apply from outside the Federal workforce. It is also used to enable current Federal employees without civil service status to compete for a &lt;span data-term=&quot;Permanent Appointment&quot;&gt;permanent appointment&lt;/span&gt; and to enable employees with civil service status to compete for other Federal positions.

## Delegated examination

A hiring authority OPM grants to agencies to fill &lt;span data-term=&quot;Competitive Service&quot;&gt;competitive service&lt;/span&gt; positions with applicants without prior Federal service, Federal employees without &lt;span data-term=&quot;competitive status&quot;&gt;competitive service status&lt;/span&gt;, or those with status. DE appointments are subject to civil service laws and regulations to ensure fair and open competition.

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/students/volunteers/">Federal agencies and departments offer unpaid training opportunities to students in high school and college. These opportunities can provide work experience related to your academic program, while allowing you to explore career options, as well as develop your personal and professional skills. As a student volunteer, exposure to the Federal work environment allows you to learn about the missions and responsibilities of various Federal agencies and departments.

## Eligibility

You are eligible to participate as a Student Volunteer if you are enrolled, at least half-time, in:

* An accredited high school or trade school;
* A technical or vocational school;
* A junior or community college;
* A four-year college or university; or
* Any other accredited educational institution.

## Duration

Student volunteer work may be performed during the school year and/or during summer or school vacation periods. The nature of your volunteer assignment as well as your weekly work schedule should be part of your work agreement. Volunteer work assignments typically have duration of 3 – 4 months.

## How To Apply

If you are interested in becoming a student volunteer with the Federal Government:

* Contact the Personnel/Human Resources Office at the Federal agency or department where you wish to work. Historically, the Departments of Defense (Army, Air Force and Navy), Commerce, Health and Human Services, Interior, Justice, State, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs have utilized the largest number of student volunteers. Telephone numbers for Federal agencies can be found in your telephone directory under &quot;U.S. Government.&quot;
* Visit your school's guidance office, career counseling, placement, or internship office for further information.

## Other Volunteer Opportunities

Besides student volunteers, other volunteer opportunities are limited since Federal agencies are not allowed by law (section 1342 of title 31, United States Code) to accept volunteer service. The few exceptions are:

* Employment in emergencies involving the protection of life or property;
* Employment of assistants to handicapped employees;
* Employment of experts and consultants; and
* Employment of students to further their educational goals.

In addition, some Federal agencies, such as the National Park Service and the Forest Service, have specific authorities to accept unpaid services for specific jobs or functions. Individuals who are interested in volunteering their services to the Federal Government should contact the agency of most interest to inquire about specific opportunities.</content>

    <id>/Help/faq/job-announcement/security-clearances/</id>
    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/faq/job-announcement/security-clearances/">If hired for a federal job, you must at least go through a basic background check to make sure you’re reliable, trustworthy, and suitable for the job. The background check process starts after you accept a job offer.

The hiring agency will ask you for the necessary personal information to start the background investigation process.  The amount of information you’ll need to give depends on the job.  

## What type of information will I need to provide?
Regardless of the type of background check, you will at least need to answer questions about where you've lived, worked, went to school, and any military history or police records. You’ll also need to have your fingerprints taken if you’ve never worked for the Federal Government. 

## Public Trust
Public Trust is a type of background investigation, but **it is not a security clearance**. Depending on the job, you must complete either the [Standard Form 85 (SF85)](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf85.pdf){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;} or [85P (SF85P)](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf85p.pdf){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;} questionnaire.

## Security Clearance
Some jobs require a security clearance. The security clearance level depends on the type of access to classified information and secure facilities that you’ll need to perform your job.

For jobs that require a security clearance, you’ll need to provide at least 10 years of personal information¬ and maybe more.  You’ll need to complete the [Standard Form 86 (SF86)](https://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/sf86-non508.pdf){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}.

Read the **Background and security clearance** section of the job announcement to see what security level is required. If you have questions about the background investigation process, contact the hiring agency for the job.</content>

    <id>/Help/faq/job-announcement/bargaining-units/</id>
    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/faq/job-announcement/bargaining-units/">Some job announcements may say &quot;This is a bargaining unit position&quot;.  A bargaining unit position is a job that is represented by a labor union. Bargaining units cover more than half of the jobs in the Federal Government. Labor unions negotiate various conditions of employment for these jobs, however they don’t generally negotiate compensation or other matters that the management team deems to be their sole prerogative.

If your job is in a bargaining unit, you don't have to join the union. However, if you want to join a union, your job must be in a recognized bargaining unit.

### Appeal rights

Typically, you need to be in a bargaining unit job if you want to file a complaint using the negotiated grievance procedure. 

Each union has their own grievance procedures which you can find in your Union Handbook.

Another option is General Delivery service that is offered by the U.S. Postal Service.

## How does General Delivery work?

Mail addressed to you at General Delivery will be held at the area’s main Post Office for up to 30 days. All you have to do is show your photo ID to pick up your mail. Below is a format and a sample of General Delivery address:


### Format

Street address = General Delivery

City, State and Zip Code of your location + Zip Code extension 9999

#### Example

&lt;pre&gt;
John Doe
General Delivery
Anytown, NY 12345-9999
&lt;/pre&gt;

## Where can you go for more information about General Delivery?

You may speak to any local Post Office associate, call 1-800-ASK-USPS (1-800-275-8777), or visit the [U.S. Postal Service](https://www.usps.com/){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}.</content>

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/faq/application/eligibility/status-candidate/">&quot;Status candidates&quot; are current or former federal employees who have worked in the competitive service, in a &lt;span data-term=&quot;Permanent Appointment&quot;&gt;permanent appointment&lt;/span&gt; for a total of three years of qualifying service. Sometimes this is also called having 'status' or a 'career appointment'.

If you have status, you're eligible for jobs that are open to **Federal employees - Competitive service**. These are also known as merit promotion jobs.

Look for the **This job is open to section** in the job announcement.  If the job lists “Federal employee-Competitive service”, you’re most likely eligible. You can also look at the **Clarification from agency** or the **Who may apply** sections—it might say “Status candidates” or &quot;Merit promotion&quot;.

To find your old saved searches:

1. Sign into USAJOBS.
2. Go to your **Saved Searches**.
3. Click **Archived** – you’ll find your old saved searches listed here.

## Can I keep using my archived saved searches?

Yes, but if you were using any of the filters we removed, your search won’t include those any more.  

1.	Click the saved search you want to keep

    <id>/Help/faq/pay/series-and-grade/</id>
    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/faq/pay/series-and-grade/">Series and grade is the Federal Government’s system for categorizing and defining jobs. The series  is a numbered system for grouping similar occupations.  For example, a Nurse is part of the 0610 series.  A ‘grade’ refers to the [General Schedule (GS) pay scale](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/salaries-wages/){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;} – it’s the pay level for the job.  The higher the grade level, the higher the pay. The GS pay schedule is the most common pay schedule, but there are others, including the [wage scale](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-systems/federal-wage-system/){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;} and [special rates](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/pay-systems/special-rates-requests/){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}.

If you’ve never worked in the Federal Government, you don’t have to include a series or grade on your resume for previous, non-government jobs. However, when you apply, you might have to say the highest grade you’d like, or are eligible for.

## Determining which grade is appropriate

### Just starting out

If you’re just starting out in the workforce, and you have a high school diploma or as little as three months of general work experience, you can qualify for jobs at the GS-2.  If you have more months of general experience, you can qualify for the GS-3 and GS-4 levels. Starting at GS-5, jobs generally require 1 year of specialized experience to qualify.

### Graduates

When you have a degree but no specialized experience in a career field, you’re eligible for the GS-5 jobs. You can qualify for GS-7 jobs, if you maintained a B average, or met other academic credentials in college.

### Experience

To qualify for jobs at the GS-7 and higher grades, you must have specific work experience related to the job you want and its responsibilities.

### Advanced degree

You can qualify for GS-9 positions if you have a master’s degree, and for GS-11 positions if you have a doctorate.

## Steps

A “step” is a raise in salary. In the GS pay scale, each grade has 10 steps.

    <id>/Help/faq/account/login-gov/</id>
    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/faq/account/login-gov/">## What is login.gov?

login.gov is a service that offers secure and private online access to government programs, such as federal benefits, services and applications. With a login.gov account, you can sign into multiple government websites with the same email address and password.

## Why is USAJOBS using login.gov?

login.gov uses two-factor authentication, and stronger passwords, that meet new [National Institute of Standards of Technology](https://www.nist.gov/) requirements for secure validation and verification. By using login.gov, you’ll get an extra layer of security to help protect your USAJOBS profile against password compromises.

## What will happen to my USAJOBS profile?

Nothing will happen to the information stored in your USAJOBS profile.  You’ll keep all of your applications, saved searches and saved jobs.

Once you set up a login.gov account, we’ll link it back to your USAJOBS profile. The only difference is you’ll use your login.gov email address, password and security code to sign into USAJOBS.


## What do I need to do?

You need to create a login.gov account, if you don't already have one. Your old USAJOBS username and password won't work anymore. You'll need to:

1. [Create a login.gov account](https://login.usajobs.gov/Access/Transition) - you only need to do this once.
2. Enter an email address during the account set up - use the same email address you use for USAJOBS (your primary or secondary email address).
3. Create a new password.
3. Have a working phone number (mobile or landline) near you - login.gov will send you a security code.
4. Finish setting up your login.gov account.

Once you’ve finished setting up your login.gov account, you’ll go back to USAJOBS to finish the process.  Double check your USAJOBS Profile to make sure all of your information is accurate.

You need to use your login.gov email address, password and security code every time you want to sign into USAJOBS.

### What if I already have a login.gov account?

If you already have a login.gov account, you don't need to create a second one. Use your existing login.gov email address and password, plus the security code to sign into USAJOBS.  

## What email address do I use to create a login.gov account?

To keep your USAJOBS profile information, you need to use your primary or secondary USAJOBS email when you create your login.gov account. When you use the same email that you use for USAJOBS, we'll automatically link your USAJOBS profile to the login.gov account.

If you use a different email address when signing up for login.gov, we won't be able to automatically link your profile. But, we can use your USAJOBS primary or secondary email address to help you recover your profile.

We recommend you don’t use a .gov, .mil or .edu email address. Instead, you should use a personal (non-government) email address when you create your login.gov account.

[You also can’t use an email address you share with someone else](#can-i-share-a-logingov-account-with-another-person).

### Why shouldn’t I use a .gov, .edu, or .mil email address?

If you use a .gov, .edu, or .mil email as your primary email address, and then you leave your government or military position or school, you won’t have access to that email address anymore. Without access to that email address, it will be much harder to verify who you are, if you need to reset your password. You also won’t get emails about jobs and other important USAJOBS information.

Using a personal email address that you control (such as a Gmail account), is the best way to make sure you can always get to important USAJOBS messaging and profile information.


## What if I currently use a .gov, .mil, or .edu email address for my USAJOBS primary email?

If you currently use a .gov, .mil or .edu email address for USAJOBS, you may want to change it AFTER you get through the login.gov account set-up process.

## Can I use a different email address from my USAJOBS email address, when setting up my login.gov account?

When you first create your login.gov account, you need to use the same email address you currently use for USAJOBS.  This will let us link your USAJOBS profile information to your new account. If you want to change your email address, we recommend you do it AFTER you've successfully linked your profile and login.gov account.

## Can I share a login.gov account with another person?

No. Each person needs their own login.gov account.  If you’ve shared your USAJOBS account in the past, with a spouse or child, you can no longer do this with login.gov. Each person must set up their own login.gov account, with their own personal email address (not an email that you share with someone else).</content>

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/faq/application/eligibility/difference-from-qualifications/">## What is eligibility?

Eligibility, in the federal hiring process, refers to being part of a particular group of people that an agency wants to hire – whether it’s a current federal employee, a veteran, or a recent graduate. There are several different eligibilities in the Federal Government; we call them &quot;[hiring paths](../../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/)&quot;.

For example, some jobs are only open to current or former federal employees—this means you must be a current or former federal employee to be **eligible**. Other jobs may be open to a current student or recent graduate—if you're not a current student or recent graduate, you’re not eligible.

Your eligibility has nothing to do with your work experience, skills, and other qualifications.

## Why is eligibility important?

Understanding your eligibility will help you know which jobs you should apply to. You can apply to any job, but **you may not be eligible for the job if you don’t fall into one of the required hiring paths listed on the job announcement**. If you’re not eligible, the hiring agency will reject your application.  

## What are qualifications?

Qualifications include your work experience (years, type of work), skills, education level and your overall knowledge of a particular field of study.

The hiring agency will look at your qualifications after they determine your eligibility. The hiring agency will rank you based on how well you meet the qualifications of the job.

Regardless of your qualifications, if you're not eligible, the hiring agency will reject your application and you will not be hired for that job.

## How do I know if I’m eligible for a job?

### Before you apply

You must read the **This job is open to** and **Who may apply** sections of the job announcement to see if you're eligible for the job. If you fall into one of the &quot;[hiring paths](../../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/)&quot; listed, you're [eligible](../) for the job. If you don't fall into one of those groups, you should look at a different job.

### After you apply

The agency will first review your application to see if you're eligible. If you're not eligible, they will reject your application—they won't even look at your qualifications. It doesn't matter if you have the qualifications – you must first be eligible.

If you're eligible, the agency will then look at your qualifications.

## How do I know if I’m qualified?

### Before you apply

You must read the **Qualifications** section of the job announcement. Your application must show, you have the specialized experience, education, and other qualifications listed in the job announcement.  

### After you apply

If you're eligible for the job, the agency will review your qualifications and rank you based on how well you meet the qualifications. The agency may rank you as &quot;minimally qualified&quot;, &quot;highest qualified&quot;, or somewhere in between. Based on how well you meet the qualifications, your application may, or may not, continue through the application process.

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/faq/application/documents/resume/what-to-include/">Whether you're a current federal employee or new to the Federal Government, your resume is the primary way for you to communicate your education, skills and experience.

## Before you get started

Read the entire job announcement.  Focus on the following sections to understand whether or not you qualify for the position.  This critical information is found under:

* **Duties** and **Qualifications**
* **How to Apply** (including a preview of the assessment questionnaire)
* **How You Will be Evaluated**

Make sure you have the required experience and/or education before you apply.  Hiring agencies use the job announcement to describe the job and the required qualifications, including:

* Level and amount of experience
* Education
* Training

## What to include in your resume

Federal jobs often require that you have experience in a particular type of work for a certain period of time. You must show how your skills and experiences **meet the qualifications and requirements listed in the job announcement** to be considered for the job.

### Include dates, hours, level of experience and examples for each work experience

For each work experience you list, make sure you include:

* Start and end dates (including the month and year).
* The number of hours you worked per week.
* The level and amount of experience--for instance, whether you served as a project manager or a team member helps to illustrate your level of experience.
* Examples of relevant experiences and accomplishments that prove you can perform the tasks at the level required for the job as stated in the job announcement. Your experience needs to address every required qualification.

#### Example

**Program Analyst GS-343-11**  
January 2009 - Present  
40 Hours/Week  
$63,000/Year

* Experience/Accomplishment
* Experience/Accomplishment

### Include volunteer work and roles in community organizations
Don't limit yourself to only including paid work experience. Include relevant volunteer work or community organizations roles that demonstrate your ability to do the job.

### Use numbers to highlight your accomplishments
Use numbers, percentages or dollars to highlight your accomplishments--you can find this information in things like your performance reviews, previous job descriptions, awards and letters of recommendation.

When explaining your accomplishments:

* Include examples of how you saved money, earned money, or managed money.
* Include examples of how you saved or managed time.

#### Examples

* &quot;Improved efficiency of document processing by 25% over the previous year&quot;.
* &quot;Wrote 25 news releases in a three-week period under daily deadlines&quot;.
* &quot;Managed a student organization budget of more than $7,000&quot;.
* &quot;Wrote prospect letter that has brought in more than $25,000 in donations to date&quot;.

These statements show in concrete terms what you accomplished.

## More resume writing tips

### Customize your resume
You should tailor your resume to the job announcement rather than sending out the same resume for every job. Customizing your resume helps you match your competencies, knowledge, skills, abilities and experience to the requirements for each job.  Emphasize your strengths and include everything you've done that relates to the job you're seeking. Leave out experience that isn't relevant.

### Use similar terms and address every required qualification
Your experience needs to address every required qualification in the job announcement. Hiring agencies will look for specific terms in your resume to make sure you have the experience they’re seeking.

For example, if the qualifications section says you need experience with “MS Project” you need to use the words ” MS Project” in your resume.

### Organize your resume to make it easy to understand
You need to organize your resume to help agencies evaluate your experience. If you don't provide the information required for the hiring agency to determine your qualifications, you might not be considered for the job.

* Use reverse chronological order to list your experience--start with your most recent experience first and work your way back.
* Provide greater detail for experience that is relevant to the job for which you are applying.
* Show all experiences and accomplishments under the job in which you earned it.  This helps agencies determine the amount of experience you have with that particular skill.
* Use either bullet or paragraph format to describe your experiences and accomplishments.
* Use plain language-- avoid using acronyms and terms that are not easily understood.

### Be concise
Hiring agencies often receive dozens or even hundreds of resumes for certain positions.  Hiring managers quickly skim through submissions and eliminate candidates who clearly are not qualified. Look at your resume and ask:

* Can a hiring manager see my main credentials within 10 to 15 seconds?
* Does critical information jump off the page?
* Do I effectively sell myself on the top quarter of the first page?

### Review your resume before you apply
Check your resume for spelling and grammatical errors and have someone else, with a good eye for detail, review your resume.

## Important facts about the federal hiring process

* The Federal Government does have a standard job application. Your resume is your application.
* Hiring agencies use the job announcement to describe the job and list the required qualifications and responsibilities.
* After applying, the hiring agency uses the information in your resume to verify if you have the required qualifications stated in the job announcement.
* Once the hiring agency has determined who is qualified, they may use other assessments such as interviews or testing to determine the best qualified applications.

### Cover letter

A cover letter may be included if there is additional information you wish to express to the hiring authorities that is outside of what is normally included in a resume.

### Transcripts

A transcript is a copy of your permanent academic record from a high school or college. To get a copy, contact the high school and/or college registrar office for instructions. Refer to the job announcement for specific instructions on which transcripts, if any, should be included.

## Senior Executives

### Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs)

If you're applying to a Senior Executive job within the Senior Executive Service (SES) you must demonstrate you possess the [Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs)](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/senior-executive-service/executive-core-qualifications/){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}. The ECQs define the competencies needed to build a federal corporate culture that drives for results, serves customers, and builds successful teams and coalitions within and outside the organization. The ECQs are required for entry to the SES and are used by many departments and agencies in selection, performance management, and leadership development for executive positions.

The ECQ requirement only applies to jobs within the SES.  There may be other senior executive level jobs outside of the SES that require different qualifications.

## Federal employees

### OF-306

The OF-306, [Declaration for Federal Employment](https://www.opm.gov/forms/Optional-forms/){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;} is used to determine your acceptability for Federal and Federal contract employment and your enrollment status in the Government's Life Insurance program. You may be asked to complete this form at any time during the hiring process. Follow instructions that the agency provides. If you are selected, before you are appointed you will be asked to update your responses on this form and on other materials submitted during the application process and then to re-certify that your answers are true.

### SF-50

The [SF-50](https://www.opm.gov/forms/standard-forms/){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;} is a notification of a Personnel Action. It contains your series, grade, and other information useful to you or required if applying for reinstatement. Used by current and former federal employees. [Learn how to obtain a copy of your SF-50](http://www.archives.gov/st-louis/civilian-personnel/index.html){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}.

## Veterans

### DD-214

The DD-214, &quot;Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty&quot;, is issued to military members upon separation from active service. It contains information about the veteran's dates of military service and separation. Most veterans and their next-of-kin can obtain free copies of their DD Form 214 Report of Separation and other military and medical records through the [National Archives Veterans’ Records Service](http://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records/){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;}.

### SF-15

The [SF-15 &quot;Application for 10-point Veterans' Preference&quot;](https://www.opm.gov/forms/standard-forms/){:target=&quot;_blank&quot;} is used by Federal agencies and OPM examining offices to adjudicate individuals' claims for veterans' preference.

You can apply to any job, but you may not be eligible for the job if you don’t fall into one of the required hiring paths. If you’re not eligible, the hiring agency will reject your application.

For example, anyone is eligible for jobs that are ‘Open to the public’, as long as you’re  a U.S. citizen. If you’re a current federal employee, you’re eligible for jobs that are ‘Open to the public’ and ‘Federal employees’, depending on which service you currently work for.

Look for the **This job is open to** section in the job announcement to see who’s eligible to apply.

The job announcement may list the following:

* [Open to the public](../../../working-in-government/unique-hiring-paths/public/)

    <id>/Help/working-in-government/pay-and-leave/work-schedules/</id>
    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/working-in-government/pay-and-leave/work-schedules/">A work schedule includes the hours of a day and the days of a work week that an employee is required to work. In the Federal Government, the work schedule is sometimes called a &quot;daily tour of duty&quot; and &quot;weekly tour of duty&quot;.

Some work schedules have the same hours every day and the same days every week. Others may be flexible and change from week to week or day to day. For example, a work schedule could be Monday - Friday, from 9 am - 5 pm or Wednesday - Sunday, from 4 pm to midnight.

The number of hours you work each day and the days of the week you work may vary depending on the job and the agency.

## Full-time

A full-time job requires most employees to work 40 hours per work week, or 80 hours in a pay period. There may be slight variations in this schedule.

## Part-time

A part-time job requires most employees to work less than 40 hours per work week, or less than 80 hours in a pay period. The number of hours may vary depending on the job.

## Shift work

Shift-work requires coverage 24 hours per day, and sometimes 7 days per week. A shift-work job means you’ll work during a set period of time within that 24 hour period. You may work a night shift, morning shift or you may rotate shifts with other workers. The exact schedule may vary depending on the job.

## Intermittent

An intermittent job requires you to work from time to time – there is no set schedule. This is not the same as a part-time job.

## Job share

A job share job requires you to share a full-time job with another employee. You and the other employee share the full-time job responsibilities and receive salary and benefits on a pro-rated basis. Each job sharer can work up to 32 hours per week and your schedule could include half days, alternative days, alternative weeks or other arrangements. The exact schedule will depend on the job.

## Multiple schedules

A job with “multiple” work schedules usually means there is more than one position that can be filled and the work schedules may vary for each job.

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/working-in-government/myths/have-to-know-someone/">&lt;strong&gt;False:&lt;/strong&gt; You do NOT need to know someone to get a federal job. If you are qualified for a federal position, you can write a competitive federal resume. Make sure you add your knowledge, skills, and accomplishments (KSAs) into your resume and answer the questionnaire giving yourself all the credit that you can. You have to apply correctly following the directions. You CAN get &quot;best qualified&quot; and &quot;referred to a supervisor&quot; without knowing anyone in the government.</content>

    <content type="html" xml:base="/Help/working-in-government/myths/need-security-clearance/">&lt;strong&gt;False:&lt;/strong&gt; Not all jobs require a security clearance. You can find this information in the job announcement.

However, all Federal positions require the candidate to undergo a suitability adjudication process to determine if the individual is suitable for Federal employment. This means that in addition to meeting the qualifications of a job announcement, an individual is determined likely or not likely to be able to carry out the duties of a Federal job with appropriate integrity, efficiency, and effectiveness.</content>
