I received a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago specializing in empirically applying contract theory to
health insurance markets. After graduate school, I worked for three years in an economic consulting firm focusing on
labor disputes, and five years in soft-money research positions at the University of California.
These work experiences led me to realize that my ideal job is a position that offers opportunities to apply my
microeconometric skills to health care policy issues and provides work-life balance and stability.
This realization, as well as my recently becoming a U.S. citizen, motivated me to pursue an economist position in the
federal government. Fortunately, I secured an economist position in the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA)
in the Department of Labor (DOL).

The EBSA position matches well with my realization for four reasons. First, it utilizes my microeconometric skills
because part of my job is to critique contract research on health care issues, such as workplace wellness programs and
elderly care. Second, this position utilizes my work experiences because in my prior position, I worked on the
contractor side of a federal research contract. This experience gives me the unique capacity to manage the extensive
research contracts at EBSA because I am intimately
familiar with contractorsâ€™ perspectives. Third, DOL values work-life balance, which makes it easier for me to balance my
professional and personal lives.
This balance is important because it lays a strong foundation for professional satisfaction. Finally, the EBSA position
is a hard-money position, which enables me to focus my energy on my professional responsibilities, without worrying
about funding for next year. Overall, I am happy with my position and believe that I can make significant contributions
to EBSA.
